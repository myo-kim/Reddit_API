0,t3_b3ss3q,"tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

---

It is easier for us to act on a policy when we communicate it clearly. So, I want to clarify one of our rules, and then bring forward how we decide to remove topics under this rule. 

&gt;Posts must be news items relevant to investors. Do not post news items not relevant to investors. We are not a politics or general ""corporate"" news forum. We generally expect that your topic incites responses relating to investing.

The issue is that we attract any sort of news article, regardless of relevance. A lot of these topics get removed, and sometimes they are even upvoted topics, but the comments are littered with off-topic discussion. 

This is frustrating because in many cases the article COULD have been relevant information to investors, but unfortunately none of the relevant information is being commented on or brought up in the body of the post. 

&gt;We generally expect that your topic incites responses relating to investing.

This means that **the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion.** As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic. 

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate. 

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. **If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.** 

---

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go: 

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic. 

* If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments. 

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

* If the policy above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news. "

I got a summary of the company's history, a business plan, and about 6 years of financial projections in a spreadsheet.  The spreadsheet has little explanation/description, but there appears to be some significant existing/planned debt.  The valuation he is asking for it is pretty high, but if they hit their projections (they're pretty lofty), I would recover my investment in 5-6 years.

I've watched him (from afar) start the business from the ground up, and on a few occasions have had some conversations about the business itself and 1-2 years ago I was hoping he would have a need for investors.  My only concern now is that the business may be at the point where the valuation is too high for me to get any reasonable ownership percentage with the little funds I have to play with."

Okay so this company doesn't exactly meet my personally happy investing criteria (high ROIC, high FCF yield, and high earnings yield, because it only has a high FCF yield and none of the others). They're a company that invests in American ethanol companies. I currently have the equity valued at $142.68 a share and it isn't trading at that. Or close to that. Or even trading with triple digits. It's trading at half that. So you best believe that I'm currently trying to figure out why they're trading at not that.

&amp;#x200B;

A few things from the balance sheet that I found that may answer this question:

**I. They're not a very diversified company. It all depends on ethanol being a big ticket item (page 16 of the annual report).**

&amp;#x200B;

**II. They have money sitting in banks that exceed federally insured limits. And if 2008 taught us anything, it's to not trust the solvency of banks to be there when you need it (page 21).**

&amp;#x200B;

**III. They have a large investment in eSteam, a technology that is patented (but not tested) to utilize steam to extract deep heavy oil (**which sounds so cool it really does**). They invested $2 million on a patented but untested item and it can backfire (page 21).**

&amp;#x200B;

**IV. The general movement away from ethanol products in general and moving to alternate sources of energy.**

&amp;#x200B;

**V. They have a large investment in a refined coal operation that only has one customer and is run by a third party (page 19).**

&amp;#x200B;

Their performance ratios have decreased over the past six years which I think reflects the attempts to move to cleaner versions of energy instead of ethanol and coal. Book value per share has been increasing steadily for the past six years though and it's trading very close to its book value, trading at 1.01x P/B. I'm looking for some more insight on this company because I think this could be a solid opportunity but I also admit **I'm rather clueless about this opportunity.**"
15,t3_cappxq,"Here's a quick definition of land syndication:  **Real estate syndication** is a simple transaction between a Sponsor and a group of investors. ... **Real estate syndication** is an effective way for investors to pool their financial and intellectual resources to invest in properties and projects much bigger than they could afford or manage on their own. 

It was in 2012 that I purchased shares in a land syndication project (my share was $10,000) through a small local investment team. At the time, there was a boom in the Oil &amp; Gas section in Alberta (the crashed happened in late 2014) and as a result, real estate throughout the province was also in high demand. The land purchased is located near a small town with various developers eyeing the location, according to the investment team. They ""promised"" a likely 20% return in less than 2 years. 

Fast forward to 2019, still no developers looking to buy this land. We get annual updates saying things are picking up but real estate market is still cold and basically no deal any time soon. Even worse, I'm paying \~$200 annually for ""management fees"" to a bank that's holding these assets. I tried calling the bank to see if I can divest and they said no. I'm guess the only way to get out is to have someone else purchase these shares from me? Any other ways or is my money locked-in indefinitely? How do I even know that money is still there? The so called ""investment team"" has long re-branded. I assume I'm one of the lucky ones with just $10,000 in play. Anyone with similar experiences, please do share your knowledge.

**TL;DR,** threw $10,000 into a land syndication 7 years ago thinking I'd make a quick 20% return within a couple of years. Now, 7 years on, I have seen zero returns, pay \~$200 a year in admin fees and have no idea if I'll ever get my money back. If you have encountered similar circumstances before, please share you insight on what I should do next."

&amp;#x200B;

Let's say a guy named Bob decides he is going to try his hand at trading in the stock market, so he saves up $5,000 and opens a brokerage account as a US resident. He hears people talking about some random penny stock and he naively decides to invest the entire $5,000 into it and then goes about his business. The very next day he logs onto his account and discovers that by nothing short of a miracle, the stock has skyrocketed and his $5,000 investment is now worth a million dollars. Then let's say Bob continues buying and selling over the course of the same year taking wild risks, and by the end of the year he loses everything and is left angry and bitter, wondering what happened.

You also know that company X is in a highly dynamic industry/sector (technology, politically influenced, emerging markets, etc.) and you recognize that there is risk the stock could swing wildly the other direction given the wrong industry news/development, though the company itself is generally well run and respected as a leader in the market the company is active in and the industry/sector has room to grow.

From your perspective, would you be more inclined to sell this type of stock after a year of ownership, recognizing that annual gains of 30-40% are well above average expectations, or would you hold onto it, considering there is potential for additional strong growth?

29,t3_cacncw,"I will tell you right now that I got the idea to look at this company from a Barron's article. And my vindication for this being okay is twofold:  


**I. Charlie Munger read Barron's for fifty years, invested in one company that was recommended by a writer there, and made $80 million off of it. I can provide the Youtube link with him saying this himself. So if he can make money from Barron's then why can't I?**

&amp;#x200B;

**II. If ""do your own research"" is the bromide for a subreddit dedicated for this investing then I'm here for it. And that's what I did.**

&amp;#x200B;

I want simplicity with trying to look at a company so I stick with Greenblatt's ""magic formula"" if you will. For the uninitiated, that is looking at ROIC (I have three different calculations for this on all of my spreadsheets because there's no formally accepted/GAAP official way to calculate ROIC so I cover my bases as much as I can), earnings yield (calculated as EBIT/EV), and FCF yield (calculated on a firm basis and an equity basis, not hard to do). 

&amp;#x200B;

I am looking for what Greenblatt suggests to look for in his book *The Little Book that Still Beats the Market*: **I want a 6% earnings yield and 7-9% FCF yield, and as high as 50% ROIC (but honestly I wouldn't complain if I got at least 30% ROIC).** I admit here that I calculate ROTCE (which I have a hunch is the way that Greenblatt calculates ROIC) based off of how Yefei Lu calculates it in his book *The Investments of Warren Buffett*, which is the following: **PPE+Inventories+Accounts receivables-Accounts payable.** I calculated net tangible equity in the following manner also: **Book value (shareholder's equity)-Goodwill-Intangible assets (you can subtract preferred equity also but I don't get that nitpicky and also a lot of companies I've found haven't issued it, but you may encounter otherwise).** 

&amp;#x200B;

A few things I see here: A television company that has increased ROIC, ROTCE, and BVPS for the years 2013-2018 in the wake of streaming services becoming the main way people consume their media and news has done amazingly well. This is no small feat and speaks highly of their management team. Two of the companies largest shareholders are the CEO and Lead Independent Director. If there's something that I want to see in a company's management is their being ball and chained to the company's success, and from the proxy statement the CEO's family are also shareholders as well (apparently the shares are in trusts for the family also, but the family is ball and chained too and so I like the incentive given for the management team to not royally fuck up). The company's operating profit has grown 35.90% in an era where streaming services have stolen market share. And with 2020's presidential elections commanding attention from more viewers, it's shaping up to be a year or two where Gray Television may see increased revenue. They are sitting on a lot of debt after completing their merger with Raycom Media, but I do not doubt the management team's ability to see the company through deleveraging the balance sheet and really squeezing the towel dry (so to speak) with getting value out of that acquisition. For my quantitative metrics needing to be met, the company meets these significantly and are highlighted in the spreadsheet.

Let's assume you have two people and one has a Roth and the other a traditional. And they both:

1. Put 5k a year in for 20 years (totalling 100k)
2. Invest in the exact same things
3. Both accounts have 300k in them after 20 years.

The traditional ira person didn't pay taxes on the first 100k... but now has to pay taxes on all 300k. 

So unless the traditional ira persons taxes are 3x lower than they were when they were contributing, it seems the Roth ira is the clear winner. 

Am I correct in this assessment or am I missing something? Because it seems like the Roth is an absolute no brainers in almost all circumstances since I cant really conceive of someone's tax bracket being 3x lower in retirement unless they are withdrawing almost nothing.

Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world’s biggest brewer, announced in May that its Asia-Pacific subsidiary, Budweiser Brewing Company APAC Limited, had filed to list shares on the HKEX.

The company is seeking to raise as much as $9.8 billion and began taking orders from investors Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported. The IPO would debut on July 19 and value the business at as much as $63.7 billion.

J.P. Morgan Securities (Far East) Limited and Morgan Stanley Asia Limited are the joint sponsors for the IPO, AB InBev announced in May.

In its first quarter earnings report, company management listed China as one of its “key markets” that drives growth. Its revenue in China grew by 7.8 percent. Also, they said the listing will accelerate efforts to pay off the company’s large debt.

AB InBev is worth about $172 billion, with Asian operations accounting for as much as a third of that, the Associated Press reported.

In China, per capita beer consumption has declined recently, with consumers favoring craft beer, wine and local spirits, The Wall Street Journal reported. But revenues in the competitive market have still grown as drinkers choose more expensive options, helping brewers in the country trade at higher valuations than elsewhere, where beer volumes have slowed.

AB InBev’s portfolio of brands and position in the industry “provide an attractive platform” for potential mergers and acquisitions in the region, the company said in its earnings report. Pulling in more brands could help Budweiser APAC control a larger portion of the highly competitive Asian-Pacific beer market, where the top three brewers have less than half of the market share, the Journal reported.

Assuming I want to take these funds out at the same time, it benefits me to have all IRA funds in FCNTX and all taxable funds in FXAIX rather than the other way around, right? Is this just because the actively managed fund creates more capital gains along the way, and if it is in a tax advantaged account, you don't have to pay along the way?

Please let me know if I'm missing something.
Thank you!"

The Federal Reserve’s debate shifted from how much to cut interest rates later this month to whether to move at all after hiring in June trumped the expectations of economists.

Yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries jumped to 1.87% from 1.76% the day before, reflecting reduced odds of the Fed aggressively reducing borrowing costs in the near term. Fed funds futures, which had been indicating some possibility of a half-point rate cut in July before the Labor Department’s data, are now pricing a quarter-point reduction this month, and at one point on Friday even showed that outcome was less than 100% certain."
57,t3_c9z3tf,"I frequently hear about this concept of ""risk adjusted returns"" and I'm trying to understand how this is actually quantified. Seems to me this is a very fluid and arbitrary concept that would be very hard to actually put a number on, but high profile investors constantly throw out very specific numbers for their risk adjusted returns so obviously they are quantifying their risk in a very specific way. Is this something that I could do as a retail investor to try to refine my investment approach? 

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe a hypothetical would help to examine this: Say bob buys 10 shares of XYZ at $100 and at the same time Jim buys 10 shares of XYZ at $100, but puts a stop loss at $95 (effectively defining his risk). XYZ moves to $200 and they both sell. Bob makes 100% return but also exposed himself to (some amount?) of risk. Meanwhile Jim has made 100% returns but only exposed himself to 5% of risk. So from here is there a formula to calculate this? Is this even relevant to risk adjusted returns? Obviously simply setting a stop loss is probably the most crude method for risk management but regardless....am I just completely off in the weeds here? 

&amp;#x200B;

Any thoughts or suggestions for resources to learn more about this would be greatly appreciated."
58,t3_ca81f3,"I've been coming across articles that the treasury yield curve has historically been one of the most reliable indicators of recessions, and that for the past quarter it has indicated as such.

I recently refinanced my house, and have a decent amount of equity I pulled out that I intent to reinvest in another property for rental income purposes. However, with a recession looming I am apprehensive to go in on a new house, if I am to lose out on it's value only a few months later, thereby over paying for a home that I could otherwise get a better deal for if I had waited. 

To hedge against this, I thought maybe one could short the stock market, then pull out and reinvest when the market and prices are down? I'm not familiar with what kind of an investment vehicle is best for something like this, as other than group pension plans I have never done any direct investing in the stock market myself. 

Is this even a viable option for this up coming recession, or am I just playing into the ""following the herd"" mentality due to the fact that people are already talking and predicting it?

Will housing prices be effected the same way as they did in 2008? Will interest rates plummet again in an attempt to boost spending? Essentially how would this one be different than the last one and how could one(and myself) hedge against such a downturn?

A lot of thoughts/questions here but I would love some insight from people smarter than I on the complexities a recession."

66,t3_c9p4kr,"So some months ago I read the book ""A Random Walk Down Wallstreet"" and I remember a chapter where the author said something along the lines that flipping a coin and charting its outcomes (heads = price increase, tails = price decrease) would result in a realistic looking stock chart filled with ""trends"" and ""patterns"". He was arguing against ""technical analysis"" (that whole chapter was hilarious btw). So I actually tried this now and his statement was actually pretty accurate.

So I wrote some code (see below if interested) that loops a few thousand times and randomly (coin flip) decided if the stock was gonna go up or down. The price moved randomly between 0-99 cents on each loop. So let's say we simulated this for 5000 days. Each day the stock will go up a random value between $0.00 - $0.99 OR down a random value $0.00 - $0.99.

Hello,

I'm a 36 year old in a well paying position where I max out my IRA &amp; Roth every year, while also getting contributions to a pension in a field that I'm very happy in, and want to work in at least part-time until I die. I also usually take a few thousand from my savings and invest in index &amp; individuals stocks after taxes each year.

In early 2016, I got interested in crypto and put down at the time a substantial amount of my flex spending into Ethereum on coinbase over a few months. I watched the 2017 bubble come and go, and watched a %15000 return trickle back down into a %3000 return on roughly 600 coins in the course of a year. I've already sold my principal (about $10k) and am looking for advice on if my exit strategy sounds reasonable:

When the market hits $1000/eth again, begin selling off 50k a day and don’t stop until 1/2 my coins are sold

 I estimate this will give me a windfall of about $255,000 return after taxes.

\-Split between 3 separate FDIC insured banks.

 Hold for 1 year while consulting CPA in advance on minimizing tax burden.

\-Talk to a fee-only financial advisor about how to split investment

 among total market index funds/bonds

\-Repeat process each time price doubles past $1000 (i.e. 2,000 or 4,000)

I understand that not selling at current prices (about 300/ea) is a significant risk, but based on my current retirement track it seems like a calculated one to me. I'm on track to retire with a comfortable nest egg at 60, but holding off and selling a little more strategically could shoot me into semi-retirement by my late 40's and give me a lot of flexibility on my shorter-term financial goals (traveling, more selective work projects, ect).

70,t3_c9nrvz,"With ‘whatever it takes’ becoming the global central bank motto after Powell’s conciliatory December speech, most arguments against owning gold have evaporated. “It generates no cash flow” becomes significantly more appealing as real yields on large portions of the global bond market enter negative territory, with the US seemingly trending towards the zero lower bound.

&amp;nbsp;

I understand this is a relatively contrarian opinion on here, but the market is not yet pricing in enough cuts into 2021. While the short-end of the curve may whipsaw due to trade developments, it will end decidedly lower without moving higher again this cycle. Let me repeat that: the Federal Reserve will not raise rates or tighten again this cycle. December was both a policy error and proof that a.) rate increases are intolerable given the amount of outstanding debt ex households b.) the world is awash in dollar denominated debt and decreasing overseas liquidity will crush global economic activity.

&amp;nbsp;

Let me point out that the equity market seems to be the only thing anyone on this subreddit focuses on, however it’s also the least relevant capital market. The bond market is *screaming* that a policy error has occurred, and the bond market typically ends up being correct. Does that mean stocks have to come plummeting to earth? Hardly. In fact, given rhetoric around the globe it has obviously become a mandate of the global monetary authorities to continue the economic expansion at all costs. The why is more difficult, but my personal opinion is that another global economic recession has been deemed untenable given the worldwide rise of populism since 2008. People are angry about their circumstances, angry about inequality, and although paradoxically a recession tends to decrease inequality, it would also lead to a drastic rise in populism and discontent.

&amp;nbsp;

Conventional wisdom is that the central banks are out of ammunition; they aren’t. A few things have changed:

a.) Central banks are quite blatantly working in concert and coordinating policy responses.

b.) Globalization means that barring capital controls interest rates should trend together barring outliers (eg Venezuela). US govt credit is the last risk-free asset with a reasonable yield, and it appears to be the last domino to fall.

c.) QE was a paradigm shift. If an authority controls the money supply and is willing to perform OMOs on any asset class, they can without a doubt support prices within that asset class. Could equities be next? Japan has blazed the path in monetary policy and ETF purchases are where they are presently at. 

&amp;nbsp;

So, do I believe central bankers can prevent a deflationary bust or global economic slowdown akin to 2008? If you had asked me ten years ago I would have referenced ‘this time is different’ in jest. Today, I’m not so sure. I’m confident that they could prevent a credit crunch and bust in asset prices a la 2008 *if* policy is coordinated on a global scale. The question now seems to be whether they should. Recessions often entail creative destruction and the loss of jobs whereas Japan has shown that perpetually depressed rates (eg no hurdle rate) can lead to zombie companies and potentially lower growth going forward. There’s obviously way more to it than that, but this post is getting long and I haven’t even talked about gold miners yet. 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, why should one own some form of gold? When it’s clear that a slowdown is ahead, central banks around the globe are going to go further negative and ease like the status quo depends on it, because it does. Presently almost every leading indicator I follow is showing a slowdown in global economic activity, and while it may not presage a recession, the stark policy pivot we’ve seen from *every* major central bank across the globe is what people should be paying attention to.

&amp;nbsp;

You might ask, why not own bonds then? Why *junior* gold miners instead of the physical metal? I’ll start with the first. There’s a few reasons why bonds seem less appealing than gold on a forward looking basis. I’d argue that the biggest predictor of bond returns on a forward-looking basis is starting yield, but that’s largely irrelevant when most simply want a portfolio hedge. Well, I’ve got good news for you, why do bonds go up in a recession? Because yields go down. So if you presently own Treasuries as a hedge you’re essentially betting that yields will approach and potentially go below zero in the event of a slowdown. Well let me tell you, regardless of economic conditions the smart money will flock to gold when there’s no longer an opportunity cost to holding it over risk-free assets, and that happens when real interest rates approach zero. If you don’t see a use case for a metal that has historically acted as a store of value (over time), compared to a currency that’s been around for ~300 years, is engineered to be inflationary and is currently priced to lose money over time, then I’m not sure what to tell you. The only case in which treasuries or sovereigns will make money is a case in which junior gold miners will almost assuredly make more money.

&amp;nbsp;

And finally, why junior gold miners instead of gold? Well, it’s simple really: gold isn’t an asset that produces cash flows so I’m using it largely as a hedge. Instead of holding 40% bonds I’m sitting at around 10% GDXJ and 7.5% other miners that exhibit a sort of optionality in relation to gold price; the miners have low debt &amp; expenses with a cost of production well above the current price of gold, so they act in a sense as an OTM call on gold, have a low cost of carry and lower bankruptcy risk than the index. 

&amp;nbsp;

Alright, that’s the end of the line for me. I’ve spent too much time writing this and if I add much else it’ll become even more convoluted.

&amp;nbsp;

Edit: Wanted to add a few more things. Although I find it to be exceedingly unlikely, on the off chance of some inflationary shock gold would significantly outperform bonds, even in a rising rate environment. The big downside risk is that the economy is wonderful and Powell raises rates, in which case hopefully the extra equity exposure as opposed to owning bonds would make up for some of the difference. I also think gold miners are generally a terrible investment and that this is a special situation given the current macro &amp; monetary environment. I do not plan to hold miners and rebalance for years, if my thesis plays out I’ll begin paring my position as rates (FFR) approach 0. Don’t be surprised to see a short-term reversal going into the July Fed meeting. IMO many headwinds for gold will abate as it becomes more obvious that this slowdown in global leading indicators likely isn’t transient or entirely related to the trade war."

2. Buying the equivalent 2x leveraged ETF (SSO)

The 10-year trailing return of IVV is 14.62%, so option 1 would have yielded me 14.62\*2-3.8 = 25.44%, while the 10-year trailing return of SSO is 26.17%, so it seems like the leveraged ETF is a better option (no risk of margin call too).

My buddy who considers himself a seasoned day trader (he does alright but it isn't like he's a fucking wizard, and the more I think about it he is a bit of a fuck up... but he's alright...) says I need to dollar cost average my investment into this ETF and buy chunks, like 10% of my capital at a time, and wait until the market dips to do so. Because only a damned fool would invest right now when the S&amp;P is at all time highs. 

I looked into this ideology and I found several studies showing that LSI beats DCA 2/3 of the time.

1. If ETF's are gaining a lot of popularity and therefore a lot of people are putting money into them. Would that not make the stocks in the underlying funds overvalued as essentially the ETF funds are buying these stocks no matter what?

2. With regards to tax for a managed fund, ETF or LIC with a DRP. If you have a managed fund, ETF or LIC with a DRP, when the DRP occurs, the way I understand it is, the fund automatically reinvests the dividend, so you will not receive any cash payment although you will still have to pay tax on the DRP as if you have received a cash payment. Therefore because you are not receiving cash you will have to pay tax from other money outside of your investment/fund, i.e cash stored in the bank? While this may not be a problem when you are starting up, when you have been doing it for a few years and built up quite a bit of equity you could end up paying quite a lot of tax, which would have to come from outside the fund.

There is a startup which has raised funds previously, founder currently owns 70% equity.

They are now on a subsequent funding round, by means of a convertible note. 

To attract investment in this round, they are pledging a 10% dividend to all investors in December (by which time it is quite unlikely the note will have converted)

Now, they seem to also be under the impression that this dividend will be paid to the this rounds investors, holding the convertible note

Does this make any sense to anyone?

1) How can a dividend be issued to a convertible note holder, since they have not yet triggered into actual share holdings?

2) What are the circumstances where it would make sense to issue a dividend (which they claim is affordable), but at the same time seeking additional funding, which they claim would allow for quicker scaling?

This is no silicon valley startup, its a fairly modest business.

Something doesn't sound right to me (I suspect its the owners attempt to extract capital from the business), but maybe I've misunderstood something."

The asset fee is easy to calculate.  Once a year, the investor takes 1% of the $100K for $1K.  How do you calculate the variable component though?  

* Is the variable portion collected only when dividends are paid or stock is sold (e.g. no profiting from unrealized gains)?

**Numbers:**

* Age: 29
* Location: San Francisco
* Current salary: 220K
* Current annual stock grants: \~400K at current share price
* Current vested equity: \~700K at current share price, tax already withheld at \~53% (Fed, CA, Social Security)

* What percentage makes sense to sell when the employee lockup expires to balance risk? I recall guidance to not let a single stock make up more than 10% of your portfolio, but selling so much makes me worry about taxes, especially because of this next point:
* I paid tax on the equity based on the IPO list price, and shared were withheld on my behalf. The current price is \~40% higher than the list price, and I believe selling this year would realize those gains as short-term, while I can realize them as long-term if I wait to sell in Q2 of 2020. Does it make sense to avoid selling for another \~6 months? I almost see the change in taxes on the appreciation as a hedge for a drop in the stock price."

123,t3_c93qt0,"The sentiment-driven stock market rally may not have much farther to run, Goldman Sachs says. Slowing growth or political uncertainty could suppress stock valuations, even if interest rates fall.

While Treasury yields could fall further this year, that won’t necessarily help the stock market much, Goldman Sachs says.

Normally, falling interest rates and Treasury yields boost the stock market’s performance. There are two reasons for that: First, U.S. corporate debt yields are linked to those rates, so lower yields usually mean lower interest costs. Second, low returns in safe assets like U.S. debt tend to push investors into riskier securities, including the stock market.

That dynamic may be fueling the stock market’s gains this year. More than 90% of this year’s S&amp;P 500 rally has been driven by rising valuations, not earnings growth, according to a July 1 note from Goldman Sachs equity strategist David Kostin. That essentially means the gains have been driven by sentiment and a lack of other attractive investment options—and not by improvement in corporate fundamentals.

That valuation-driven rally may not have much farther to run, the bank argues. Slowing growth or political uncertainty could suppress stock valuations, even if interest rates fall.

“While lower interest rates benefit equity valuations, the growth outlook has also weakened and uncertainty has risen,” the strategists wrote in a note.

That is why the bank predicts the S&amp;P 500 will rise just 0.6% to 3,000 by year-end, even if the 10-year Treasury yield slides to 1.75% as forecast.

On Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year U.S. yield declined to its lowest point since 2016. It fell as low as 1.94% in morning trade, following the news that International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde has been nominated to lead the European Central Bank. German 10-year government bond yields fell as low as -0.4%, which is the ECB’s current deposit rate.

For investors who are optimistic that low global yields will spur on economic growth, Goldman Sachs recommends stocks in its basket of companies with low labor costs, which includes Western Union (ticker: WU), Cboe Global Markets (CBOE), and Under Armour (UA). Those stocks have lagged behind the broader market, and trade at 15 times next year’s earnings forecasts, compared with the S&amp;P 500’s multiple of 17.

Some claims he has made, including that he was planning to take the company private, just make him seem dishonest and untrustworthy. And then, by doing things such as smoking pot on live radio, he seems too unpredictable. He would not have made the false claim about taking Tesla private and he would not have smoked pot if he were thinking about what is best for company. And then he makes these claims such as that there will be one million self-driving Tesla taxis on the road in 2020. Such claims make him seem arrogant and detached from reality. One could argue that seeming to be detached from reality is a quality of a lot of geniuses before they revolutionize their field. But I prefer somebody who is grounded and careful in everything he or she does. All of this makes Tesla seem like too risky of an investment. Sure, Elon Musk and Tesla may knock it out of the park one day. But the risk of him doing something else that hurts the company and drives the stock price down just seems to high.

Toxic company culture is built in to who they are. Leadership is aware of turn over, and their reaction is to offer $500 bucks to hire more people as opposed to retaining the skilled employees. 
In their defense, from a numbers stand point it probably makes sense. Dump the senior employees that were making more before the merger that were grandfathered in. (They already cut pay drastically for them through the commission plans) 
The commission is taxed at 35% and in a good month you’re lucky to bring home $2,500 after taxes. The people that typically do well have a “pipeline” of people that have been following up with them for years. There is no actual skill involved in the job as you are stuck taking the calls you get.

And today another group of managers told an employee “ you aren’t as good as you think you are” when she asked about why she got the shift she got. I have NEVER worked in such a toxic company. 
The whole reason I’m writing this is to warn investors to stay away and far away. 
We started offering business cellphone plans today which may appeal to investors, but the company culture WILL cause issues. And the competition coming into the market (starry, Elon musk and Amazon’s satellites, ect) will shit down a company that can’t retain employees. Also the CEO is the highest or one of the highest paid in America. Sooner or later they will automate jobs away because they can’t retain employees and customer experiences are going to be even lower than they are now. 

Anyways, sorry about the rant. Feel free to ask anymore questions and if I can answer them I will."

Obviously capital intensive and has its fair share of risk…but upside in my opinion is significant. Big data is important and they have mass amounts of data coming in. Look at the reports they are able to release on housing data…more detailed then what the government can even put together. The key point I like to push, is this does not need to kill of traditional real estate…I do not think it will…but it can definitely take a piece of the pie and more as time goes on.
I know there is other companies that do this, but none have the traffic/user data that Zillow will be able to leverage as time goes on.
 
It has had a nice run recently, so it may not be the ideal time to hop in..but that being said as of 6/14 it had 26million shares short, with only 2.8 million daily volume. There is definitely room for a large short squeeze if we see the positive momentum continue.

165,t3_c8srk9,"Fellow Redditors, 

I’m having an issue understanding some basics regarding the covered call options strategy. 

By purchasing 100 shares of ABC company at $20 per share, and selling one contract of ABC at a strike price of 22.50 with a $0.50 premium, it seems losses only occur when the stock price goes below $19.50 (Stock purchase price - premium received). 

However, I don’t understand how, if the stock price rose to $24 and the Option contract was exercised by the buyer, we wouldn’t lose $2,250 ($22.50 x 100 shares) - $50 in premium. 

If that is true, wouldn’t this be an incredibly risky trade with minimal room for positive return?

So I live in Belgium and as a freelance software developer I want to invest with money from my company. I will not dive to deep into the personal tax situation in my country but simply put: any money I take out of my company to pay myself gets taxed close to 50% (depending on the amount).Since I can pay a bunch of things with funds from my company(house, travel, restaurants, clothes, car,...) it's a lot more efficient to leave the money inside my corporation.

So I read some books on how to grow that money and decided that something in the style of Ray Dalios all weather portfolio with global market index funds is probably the best way to go.I did some research and apparently my gov changed some rules that made it impossible for me to invest in stocks with corporate money. Here are the rules:

\- There is a 30% corporate tax on any profits. Since early 2018, this also applies to gains from the stock market. Any losses are not deductible.

There a few exceptions:

\- Investments over 2.5m are taxfree (well, 0.74% in stead of 30%)

\- Buying 10% or more of a company is also basically tax free

(spicy detail, these rules were reverse until early 2018 but fuck small business it seems)

\- Investments in a so called DBI-bevek fund is also free from the above tax.

So obviously I did some research in the various DBI funds that Belgian banks offer. Results for 3 of the biggest banks :

\- [KBC is the biggest bank, they have 3% frontload and 1.83% yearly fees](

\- [Belfius is second biggest. The links to their funds are dead](

\- [Finally Crelan, they have 2.5% front load and 1.6% yearly](

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I can choose, either I pay 30% yearly tax on profits without deducting losses or I pay heavy front load with heavy yearly actively managed fees.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, what do I now?

Do I start a holding company abroad and move my money there. This comes pretty close to tax evasion probably.

Do I take the pain and just pay the actively managed fees?

Do I invest anyway and hope I can hold any index ETF until the law changes? Taxes are only due when I sell.

Do I invest solely in real estate? With investments in real estate the profits are taxed equally heavily but at least the costs are deductible(even interest on a loan is considered a tax deductible cost).

Is there another option?

**TLDR: Passive investing and individual stocks are basically not allowed in Belgium for small business owners. Do I take the pain of actively managed funds or are there alternatives?**"
193,t3_c8k0ts,"So recently I’ve been brought to the attention of *leveraged ETFs* 

They can mimic the S&amp;P 500, which if you stay in it long enough always go up. 

But they can be leveraged. 2-4x leveraged. 

Apparently if they make an return  it’s 2-4 times higher than their non leveraged ETF counterparts (for normal S&amp;P 500 etf it’s about 9-11% annually; now imagine it being 2-4 times higher than that return) 

But also fall 2-4x as fast if the market goes down. 

But I’ve just stated that the market always go up with time.

So why is it that people say leveraged S&amp;P 500 ETFs are considered speculations and not investments when clearly if you invest in them you can make returns as high as Warren Buffet?

For example hedging against the SandP500 by investing some on the inverse would be a hedge I think? If it worked correctly and you did 50% in each I believe the net gain is just 0 minus fees. It seems to me if you invest in something you expect to go up and hedge some against your funds going up all you accomplish is dragging your returns in exchange for losing less in downturns. Your investment should go up over time so hedging a small portion just drags that number down in exchange for not seeing as much money lost in downturns. So what’s the point of investing in something that zigs when the market zags if you expect the market in the end will yield positively?

My example may not make much sense so what about having anything in bonds for the long term? The stock market will beat bonds in the long term so what benefit is there? Doesn’t it just drag returns in up years which happen more often in exchange for losing less money in downturns which happens less often?"

2nd scenario: I buy individual stocks, hold it for 1 year, sell it and trade it for a new stock. For example, let's say on year 1, I bought AAPL, earned 7%, sold it a year later.

1. How much less money would I have on the 2nd scenario if we assume I'd be earning 7% average on both buy and hold for 10 years, and trade ""better"" stocks every 1 year (will always be long term hold to avoid short term tax).

&gt; Longtime Boeing engineers say the effort was complicated by a push to outsource work to lower-paid contractors.

&gt; The Max software -- plagued by issues that could keep the planes grounded months longer after U.S. regulators this week revealed a new flaw -- was developed at a time Boeing was laying off experienced engineers and pressing suppliers to cut costs.

&gt; Increasingly, the iconic American planemaker and its subcontractors have relied on temporary workers making as little as $9 an hour to develop and test software, often from countries lacking a deep background in aerospace -- notably India.

&gt; Boeing said the company did not rely on engineers from HCL and Cyient for the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, which has been linked to the Lion Air crash last October and the Ethiopian Airlines disaster in March. The Chicago-based planemaker also said it didn’t rely on either firm for another software issue disclosed after the crashes: a cockpit warning light that wasn’t working for most buyers.

&gt; Engineers who worked on the Max, which Boeing began developing eight years ago to match a rival Airbus SE plane, have complained of pressure from managers to limit changes that might introduce extra time or cost.

&gt; “Boeing was doing all kinds of things, everything you can imagine, to reduce cost, including moving work from Puget Sound, because we’d become very expensive here,” said Rick Ludtke, a former Boeing flight controls engineer laid off in 2017. “All that’s very understandable if you think of it from a business perspective. Slowly over time it appears that’s eroded the ability for Puget Sound designers to design.”

&gt; Rabin, the former software engineer, recalled one manager saying at an all-hands meeting that **Boeing didn’t need senior engineers because its products were mature.** “I was shocked that in a room full of a couple hundred mostly senior engineers we were being told that we weren’t needed,” said Rabin, who was laid off in 2015.

&gt; Starting with the 787 Dreamliner, launched in 2004, it sought to increase profits by instead providing high-level specifications and then asking suppliers to design more parts themselves. The thinking was “they’re the experts, you see, and they will take care of all of this stuff for us,” said Frank McCormick, a former Boeing flight-controls software engineer who later worked as a consultant to regulators and manufacturers. “This was just nonsense.”

&gt; Boeing has also expanded a design center in Moscow. **At a meeting with a chief 787 engineer in 2008, one staffer complained about sending drawings back to a team in Russia 18 times before they understood that the smoke detectors needed to be connected to the electrical system**, said Cynthia Cole, a former Boeing engineer who headed the engineers’ union from 2006 to 2010.

&gt; U.S.-based avionics companies in particular moved aggressively, shifting more than 30% of their software engineering offshore versus 10% for European-based firms in recent years, said Hilderman, an avionics safety consultant with three decades of experience whose recent clients include most of the major Boeing suppliers.

&gt; With a strong dollar, a big part of the attraction was price. Engineers in India made around $5 an hour; it’s now $9 or $10, compared with $35 to $40 for those in the U.S. on an H1B visa, he said. But he’d tell clients the cheaper hourly wage equated to more like $80 because of the need for supervision, and he said his firm won back some business to fix mistakes."

262,t3_c7x2z2,"It seems to me that all long term investors should be borrowing money to invest. The turnoff is the massive downside risk but the longer you are in the market the lower the risk. 

All long term investors expect to have a net gain so why not double the amount you have invested through a margin loan? Am I missing something here?

Edit I did some research and math and I think it absolutely a good idea so long as you can avoid a margin call. This is not very hard so long as you don’t take out more than you can handle. 

The math on a 30 year investment using some leverage looks really good. If you borrowed 25k and paid a 10% interest on that loan over the course of 30 years you would end up paying 75,000k or 2,500 a year. Over the short term it may look tough to cover that interest, you’d need to match that 10% every year just to break even with added risk. However while your 10% interest is a flat rate on 25k your interest gained is compounding. Over the course of 30 years a 25k investment only yielding 5% a year would gain you 83k in interest vs the 75k you paid for the loan.

Edit 2: maybe not a great idea because 1st didn’t factor in opportunity cost the other way. If you took interest payment out of investment it destroys your returns. To get the numbers I did above you have to pay interest owed outside the account or reinvest the amount taken out due to interest. What I did not take into account is that if you can afford these fees, you can afford to invest that amount if you didn’t borrow. My basic math would be on an investment calculator-

Leveraged-

50k, 30 years, 5%= $216,097-$25,000(amount borrowed)-$75000 (interest paid)= $116,097

Original-

25k, 30 years, 5%, $2500 yearly contribution (instead of paying interest yearly you invest this amount yearly)= $274,146

If you could not pay $2500 yearly on fees without taking away from investment it would destroy your leveraged returns, if you could, missing out on the reinvestment is the opportunity cost."

275,t3_c825wf,"**Hey ladies &amp; gents,**

So I've been looking into ways to start investing... Everyone says, *""Invest in 401K and ROTH IRA, max it out, etc etc.""*

While all of those things sound really good, I'm actually self-employed and have none of that... and also, ROTH IRA and most of these things have such small caps that you can't really create any substantial wealth.

Long story short, I came across Fundrise (I assume you're all familiar with it.. it's like eREITS)

I looked at their historical performance, which was as follows...

2014 = 12.25% Annualized Return

2015 = 12.42% Annualized Return

2016 = 8.76% Annualized Return

2017 = 11.44% Annualized Return

2018 = 9.11% Annualized Return

**So I just did some quick math... and if I invested $20,000/year with them for 5 years starting at the beginning of 2014, it would've went something like this...**

2014 | $20,000 total deposited | $2,450 Return | **$22,450** Investment Worth

2015 | $40,000 total deposited | $5,272 Return | **$47,722** Investment Worth  
2016 | $60,000 total deposited | $5,932 Return | **$73,654** Investment Worth  
2017 | $80,000 total deposited | $10,714 Return | **$104,368** Investment Worth

2018 | $100,000 total deposited | $11,329 Return | **$135,697** Investment Worth

&amp;#x200B;

So basically, you're telling me that by putting in 20K/year for 5 years, and reinvesting earnings, a total investment of $100,000 would be worth $135,697... that's $35,697 profit of PASSIVE investing.  


Now please explain to me, why are people not doing this? What is the down side that I am not seeing? Is this money somehow being taxed when I withdraw it and that number becomes substantially smaller?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm just trying to understand this... because I've found real estate deals where with the same investment I'd make $20K profit + initial investment back over 5 years, and there would be ZERO diversification like here.

&amp;#x200B;

Please let me know thanks. Just realized this post sounds like I'm promoting their stuff. I am not affiliated with Fundrise at all. Just curious to hear some opinions before I throw $20K/year into it. Heck, I'd throw $40K/year if it would double the return."

These two companies have had great performance price wise and relatively little downswing compared to what happened in the general market at the end of last year.

How exactly does one attempt to make a value judgement on these stocks?

I would imagine that at some point, the reality comes into play and the bull run on these prices ends as they approach the fair market value. Something like that happened to Square recently:  [

It feels not unlike playing a ponzi scheme, knowing that it will fall out from under you at some point but hard to say when. That said, the trend of 50% YoY gains is potentially worth a gamble.

That said, I have no idea what regular investors are using to determine what the ""fair value"" stopping point would be, since the normal P/E and discounted cash flow type methods don't really apply. Also, some kind of multiple on revenue or revenue growth rate measures doesn't seem to be relevant since Square has comparable ones to SHOP and NOW but unlike those ones, it did find a top.

If you don't want to read it, here is an important part of the article:

""Historically, retirees have poured into dividend-paying stocks, perceiving a stock’s dividend as an income source akin to a bond coupon that gives reliable returns over time. In a [classic paper]( by the economists Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani, the duo famously showed that investors ought to be indifferent between $1 in the form of a dividend and receiving $1 by selling shares. **This is because when a stock pays a dividend of $1, the share price drops by $1 leaving an investor with no more value than they had before the dividend was paid.** In other words, in the Miller and Modigliani framework, the distinction between “principal” and “income” is illusory. Unless there are frictions like taxes or transaction costs, equity investors can convert principal into income or vice versa according to their preferences, by either selling some stock or reinvesting dividends. This holds regardless of what the payout policy of the firm is."""

Here is one that has quite a few people disagreeing:

Jim retired at 62 and has enough money in savings and investments to not have to spend his Social Security checks.  But he has decided to collect benefits any way at 62 and invest all of his SS check money in a mutual fund that is 50% Total Stock Market and 50% Total Bond Money.  His starting money SS Check is $1500.00 which goes up 2% a year for inflation. He automatically has his Social Security checks deposited into the mutual fund every month until he dies at age 85.

Jerry, who is Jim's Twin Brother, does exactly the same thing as Jim-invests his SS Checks in a 50-50 fund, but waits until he is 70 to collect.  Because he waited to 70 and there was moderate 2% inflation each year, his monthly SS check will be $3,000, which will go up 2% a year for inflation.   But he got 8 years fewer checks than Jim because he waited to 70 to collect.  Jerry and Jim both die the same day at age 85.

Assuming a 5% return every year who will have the most money - FROM THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK INVESTMENTS- to pass on to their kids when they both die on the same day at age 85?"

&amp;#x200B;

\- Take it a step up and pick specific stocks in this sector. Ie: producers, distributors, parts suppliers. While in one regard this seems like the easy and obvious choice -- go buy the most relevant solar/wind/hydro stocks -- this also seems like it would be most exposed to company level risk...maybe the big players in the market today wont be the big players tomorrow.

320,t3_c764dx,"I had an idea which I think is good but runs completely counter to traditional investment advice. I wanted to make my pitch for it and see what everyone thinks and what Im missing.

tl;dr - Based on the studies below, I think an internationally focused, diversified equity portfolio has a higher chance of netting 3% per annum over a 35 year time horizon than a traditional domestic focused stock/bond portfolio.

**My situation** \- Im in my mid 20s. No debt and work in a moderately high paying field (IT) with a fairly secure career. Thanks to living at home for a year after college, starting investing when I was a teenager and saving like crazy, I saved quite a bit of money. Assuming I keep up IRA contributions and get 3% matching on 401k contributions for my career, I need a real return of about 3% to retire comfortably. 

**My Idea**

Given this, I think traditional advice would be to hold a decent portion of the portfolio in fixed income (bonds/CDs) and put the rest in mostly domestic stocks. I don't want to do anything particularly close to that. Here's my pitch for it:

* According to Jeremy Siegel (U Penn prof. *Stocks for the Long Run*), over 20-30 year time periods stocks show strong mean reversion and have a lower variance than bonds. ([link that shows this]( looking at returns since 1800 in the US. In the [Return on Everything Paper]( (Harvard/The Fed) which looked at global and US returns, this was more or less confirmed. 
* So, I think that over my time horizon, stocks should be less risky than bonds. Its not to say I don't need to transition to bonds toward the end of my career, for retirement, but I don't think holding them until I need to is helpful. (Im very risk/fluctuation tolerant)
* That said, I don't totally trust US equities. Our current environment matches Carlo Cipola's criteria (*Economic Decline of Empires*) for an economically declining world power pretty closely and the last decade or so has seen us move closer and closer to the characteristics he identifies as common in these situations. I also don't see the US as particularly effective or cohesive socially or politically.
* On top of this Jeremy Siegel notes that returns generated over longer periods of time have much more to do with valuations at the start of investing than the GDP growth of the country. PE ratio, although crude, does hold a decent bit of explanatory power and it is considerably higher for the US (20 or so) vs. internationally diversified ETFs (low teens). 
* Ray Dalio's Bridgewater &amp; Associates published [a piece]( which suggested that an equal-weight portfolio among developed countries would have returned something close to what the US market returned with much less volatility over the 20th century, which included 2 world wars which devastated Europe.
* That said, I don't plan on leaving the US permanently (although I think living in another country for a few years would be cool) so whatever happens here economically will have an outsized effect on me vs the rest of the world and I want to make sure I don't totally miss growth here. Also a lot of our larger companies have significant revenue from abroad (40% for the S&amp;P last I heard) so I will get some international exposure through that. Although, as Bridgewater points out, the country the business is located in matters a lot, irrespective of revenue. 
* Also, for buying international ETFs, buying an equal weighted basket of international equities is pretty expensive compared to buying internationally diversified index funds. 

So, Im thinking of putting about 35-40% in the US (VTI or similar), 25% in emerging markets (IEMG so I can get S Korea exposure) and the remainder in a mostly developed market, diversified etf (IXUS). 

&amp;#x200B;

This totally goes against most investment advice I've seen (60-70% in the US, often including some bonds, and 20-30% international). 

I imagine there are pretty good reasons why the typical advice is to invest a lot more in the US than overseas, but I don't know what they are. What am I missing here?"
321,t3_c7k1yx,"The more research do the more turned off I am. The nominal 10 year return averages 10% but that includes very old data that includes America’s transition into a global force.

That might not seem like much but 20 years is a large chunk of someone’s life and these people may have expected much larger returns than they got. Also factor in the last decade has been a very long bull run that only brought up returns from terrible to only pretty bad, add another recession in the next few years and the SandP 500 will become a pretty bad investment choice long term for many investors.

I did everything I wanted to do, studied businesses and looked for consistent growth of ROE/ROIC, operating cash per share, sales per share, eps and book value per share. Out of my whole list of companies that fit that criteria, semi's were having a double event. Inventories for both NAND and DRAM memory chips are very cyclical and seem to have hit a floor, or at least were close to the bottom of the cycle. The trade war first meeting gaffe sent them down, then the Huawei ban really hit them hard as well. A few big value investors made big bets on Micron including Pabrai etc... Micron was definitely on sale and had a good margin of safety. They still were industry leaders etc... good management, buying back stock like crazy since their FCF was still great. 

I bought 100 shares at $35. When it dropped to $33.50ish I sold a covered call on my shares with a $36 strike thinking I could scrape some premium while I waited for inventories to clear up. It was a very short option, 7/5 expy so didn't seem like much risk. Well, turns out they ""beat"" on earnings because it wasn't as bad as predicted and then the Huawei thing at G20. I knew both events were happening in the time frame too. It was sniffing $40 before the Huawei ban was lifted this am! 

I didn't lose money on it, in fact will make a very small profit but I should have just trusted all my research! Or at the least waited until the two major catalysts passed and then assessed what the situation looked like. Doh! "

Apple’s Mac, iPhone, iPad and Watch all bear his imprint. His departure marks yet another rupture between the company Apple once was and the one it is becoming. Ultra-secret hardware projects are making way for widely touted subscription services.

&gt;There is good reason for this change. Sales of smartphones, still the axis around which Apple spins, are flatlining. Unit sales of the iPhone fell 18 per cent during the first quarter compared with the previous year, according to Gartner.

&gt;Apple has managed to sell increasingly big and expensive handsets. But overall unit growth is slowing. To raise profitability, Apple must push into high-margin services, its fastest-growing segment. Even non-Apple device owners are being welcomed into the fold.

&gt;Sir Jonathan’s departure suggests services is taking priority. Apple will be a client of the new company he creates — although not its only one.

&gt;The question is what happens to projects Sir Jonathan is linked to, such as Apple smart glasses. Augmented reality headsets have not yet found their place in the world. Are they a consumer gadget or serious work tool? Design will influence reception. Sir Jonathan will hopefully remain involved. Perhaps his flat intonations will still be heard in Apple’s marketing videos. But the company’s emphasis on hardware, or at least hardware design, is likely to change.

&gt;Longer term, Sir Jonathan’s departure may influence Apple’s allocation of resources. High spending puts pressure on margins. If Apple draws back from hardware experiments, then research and development costs may fall back from 6 per cent of sales in the past quarter. Either way, the British designer’s influence has been outsize. Without him, Apple will be a different company."
341,t3_c7994a,"He's predicting a more severe crash than 2008 to occur within the next year or two.  His logic is simple: far more debt now than in 2008.  US mortgage debt is back at 2008 levels, but more importantly US non-financial corporate debt is far higher than it's ever been due to a decade of cheap money from QE.  Global debt is higher than it's ever been and China is in trouble this time with a 300% debt-to-GDP ratio, largely from unsustainable construction projects.

Factor in that derivatives trading and debt traunches were never made illegal after 2008 and continue to be widely used.  Also factor in that the Fed is currently transitioning from QT to QE BEFORE THE RECESSION IS EVEN STARTING - they're just trying to further inflate the stock-market bubble and now won't have much QE available when the crash actually does happen.

This all seems so straightforward to me, and I really don't see how it's possible that another major crash wouldn't happen in the near future."

I'm calculating only a 32% drop.  How's he getting 90%?

I just used this calculator: 

He said this in the Berkshire Hathaway meeting during his speech February 14, 2019: [

This is what he said at 27:30 of above recording: ""If you stop to think about all the expense and blabber that she didn't have to listen to and all the trouble she avoided. Zero cost. And of course, what people don't realize because they're so mathematically illiterate is if you make five percent and pay two of it to your advisors, you're not losing forty percent of your future, you're losing ninety percent. Because over a long period of time that difference causes a ninety percent disadvantage to you. It's hugely important for somebody who's a long term holder not to be paying a big annual toll out of the performance.”

363,t3_c6nhu1,"I want to confirm my understanding. If the federal reserve lowers interest rates it will mean new issue federal debt will pay less and will trickle out causing other new bonds to lower. This will inflate the value of currently held, higher interest bonds. In medium/long term overall bonds will yield less payout.

If interest goes up, the value of held bonds reduces as new bonds with higher rates come out. In medium/long term bonds overall will have a higher yield.

I'm currently invested in corporate junk bind ETF (JNK) which has annual dividends around 6% and a share price at $109. So if interest drops the share price should go up, but disbursements will go down after a year+ as new bonds enter the ETF. If interest goes down the share price goes down but in a year+ disbursements go up.

Is this the right overall assessment?

NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Mega deals set the pace for mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) globally in the second quarter of 2019, as large U.S. companies defied trade row jitters and seized on strong equity and debt capital markets to agree on transformative combinations.

370,t3_c6efhk,"Hi,

&amp;#x200B;

I am wondering why (or how) Vanguard is able to offer a lower expense ratio for its total stock market index fund ETF than it does for its mutual fund equivalent.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the pricing information from Vanguard's site:

&amp;#x200B;

**Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)** 

* Market Price: $149.05
* Premium: $0.02
* Expense Ratio: 0.03%

&amp;#x200B;

**Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Admiral Shares (VTSAX)**

* Price: $72.54
* (No premium/discount, since the price reflects NAV)
* Expense Ratio: 0.04%

&amp;#x200B;

I know that they both have rock-bottom low expense ratios, and that it is just one basis point, but I would have expected VTSAX to have a lower expense ratio due to its higher minimum investment ($3,000 for VTSAX vs. $149.05 for one share of VTI). 

&amp;#x200B;

I understand the difference between mutual funds and ETFs, but why does the ETF have a lower expense ratio? Does it have to do with the $0.02 premium built into VTI? Or, is it all a wash since you can buy partial shares of VTSAX and have more money working for you?

SPY has a CAGR of **8.97%**  (with dividend reinvestment) over the last 24 years. A $25,000 in SPY on 08/01/1995 would be worth **$196,475** today.

Our portfolio of 25 stocks has a CAGR of **11.77%** and a present value of **$361,178**.

Picking our 6 biggest winners and assuming the other 19 go bankrupt would be in line with market performance with a present value of **$198,329**.

&amp;#x200B;

Some thoughts for those who would like to build a similar portfolio

Look for companies that

* Have a business model that you understand properly.
* Consistently generate excess returns on invested capital compared to the market as a whole.
* Companies that maintain a clean balance sheet. Metrics to look at would be NetDebt/EBITDA, Debt/Equity and Interest Coverage ratio.
* Many boring consumer staples have historically outperformed the market because they grow earnings reliably and tend not to be overpriced in general.

Buy said companies when

* They are trading at a discount compared to historic levels. Metrics to look at would be EV/EBITDA, dividend yield, FCF yield.
* However, avoid buying companies that have heavily compromised their balance sheet. If the free cash flow barely covers the dividend, stay away. If the interest coverage ratio is in the low single digits, stay away.
* Avoid buying overpriced stocks. Even the best companies will offer subpar returns when you overpay. KO has slightly underperformed the market because it was trading at a PE in the 50s during its peak in the late 90s.

You can get all this information from Morningstar or Value Line that most public libraries provide free access to. Or you can calculate it from the sec filings [

Keeping this in mind will keep you from panic selling when the market sees a downturn. In fact, it’ll even help you buy excellent companies at a nice discount. **This isn't a guarantee to outperform the market, but it's a fairly straightforward approach that increases your odds of doing so**.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: To people who feel like it's easy to pick a winning portfolio in hindsight are missing the point. I'm trying to show you can build a winning portfolio from large cap blue chips without taking on unnecessary risks. The worst a company can do is go to zero. At best, the sky is the limit. You can try replacing the big winners (MO, BF.A, CHD) with a few more bankruptcies or try other names such as TGT, CPB, CLX etc and see how the portfolio performs. You probably won't be able to repeat Lynch or Buffet's performances, but a couple of hundred basis points is realistic in the long run.

For people asking why I chose the stocks I did, a professor from Wharton picked the top companies from the late 50s to see what types of companies provided the best returns. Over the past 50 years, consumer staples were some of the best performers because

1. They are generally not very capital intensive.
2. Their earnings are the least cyclical
3. Consumer staples generally trade at a lower valuations because they have lower earnings growth. This often translates to lower price to earnings growth ratios. MO and PM are two such stocks that fit that criteria today. GIS below $45 a share would also fall into that category.

It will pay a slightly higher rate on the bond due four decades from now--5.125%--than the 4.375% it paid on a 10-year bond issued in 2011.

What I'm getting from this quote is that there is high demand for 10 year bonds. Investors seek safety in the near term (economy might hit downturn) so they move to longer term? Also what's this deal about comparing interest rates? Is this simply to show that they're paying less than 1% more in interest for a loan that's due 40 years out? If corporate bonds are paying historically low yields now, why would I buy corporates? Is it because I anticipate that yields won't be low forever because the Fed will eventually have to raise the interest rate? 

Meanwhile insurance companies and other large institutional investors are moving to invest in CLOs rather than treasuries. This is a side-effect of lower yields on treasuries? 

What's surprising to me is this quote: ""The bond market is really saying that it thinks we are facing a significant slowdown or a recession and the equity market thinks there has been no change at all."" Which doesn't make a ton of sense to me since all of this seems to be perpetuated by the Fed refusing to cut rates?

504,t3_c52ts6,"Hi everyone!  Here's the original post:  [ 

\---

**Going Long on Stocks**

Going ""long"" on a stock means that if the price goes up, your profits go up.

When you buy a share, you create a sort of contract with a stock exchange that is then stored on their internal, proprietary database: their ledger.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mick Ronson, and I own one share of $FOO, purchased at $100. I have the right to sell it to a buyer at any point in the future, at a price determined by the market."" The contract is executed instantly. It's kind of like a game:

&amp;#x200B;

[

&amp;#x200B;

Long means ""up is good; down is bad"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Shorting a stock**

Shorting a stock is the opposite going long; if the price goes down when you're short on a stock, your profits go up.

Here's how shorting works¹: Given a share price of $100 that you expect to drop, you can borrow $100 from a broker and promise to pay it back in the form of one share. If the price drops, you can buy a share using this borrowed money and give it to the broker. You gain the difference.

¹: Technically, it's a bit more complicated. The above simplification is a heuristic I use because it's conceptually accurate. To quote @DivergentViewUS:

&gt;When you short, you borrow the stock, not the cash. Let's say you short 100 shares of DIS, the broker lets you borrow 100 shares from someone else's account, the broker then sells the other person's 100 shares of DIS, and then, gives you the cash which goes into your account. You then are on the hook to re-purchase 100 shares of DIS at some point in the future (called covering your short). If DIS goes down, then, you repurchase at a lower price and therefore make money.

When you're short and price increases, you either wait for it to come back down, or you eat the losses and buy a share at the higher price using the borrowed money plus some of your own money before giving it back to the broker. You'd lose the difference.

The plain-English contract between you and the exchange is: ""Hey, I'm Mick Ronson, and I have borrowed $100 from you with the promise of paying you back in the form of one $FOO share, currently valued at $100. I am on the hook to eventually get my hands on a share for you at any point in the future. If the price of one $FOO share increases to $120, I will have to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy a portion of that share, and then $20 of my own money to buy the rest of the share. I will then give you the share at a personal loss of 20%. If the price of one $FOO share decreases to $80, I will be able to use the money that I borrowed from you to buy an entire share, and then keep the extra $20 for myself."" This game is similar to the first, but flipped:

&amp;#x200B;

[

&amp;#x200B;

Short means ""up is bad; down is good"".  Each of these instruments allow you to engage with the market through a contract that records the following:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Purchase Stock`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 1`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: Buying`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: Just now (manual execution)`

&amp;#x200B;

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on the direction of a stock's price. Note that ""selling"" without a share to sell is ""shorting"".

&amp;#x200B;

\---

**Limit/Stop Orders**

The Price at time of time of contract execution doesn't have to be the current price, though. If you $FOO is currently priced at $100 and you want to go long when it hits $120 because you anticipate an upward breakout at that price, you can place a ""buy stop order"". If you want to go short when $FOO hits $120 because you anticipate a downward correction, you can place a ""sell stop order"". Even if the price of $FOO is $100, you can purchase the following contract:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Stop Order`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [New!]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 1`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: Buying`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD (price action) [New!]`

&amp;#x200B;

This contract, in contrast to the first, will only execute if and when the price equals $120. It's a more nuanced game, but not all that different from the two we've seen so far:

&amp;#x200B;

[

&amp;#x200B;

Once the share price trips the wire of your limit, the contract is executed just like the very first game we played.

A notable comment from @DivergentViewUS:

&gt;As an FYI, I've never seen anyone use this type of order among professional investors….just not the way people think. Most analysts/PMs at institutions are not buying based on momentum. This type of order might be used more by programmatic/algorithmic funds.

&amp;#x200B;

\---

&amp;#x200B;

**Options**

An option is a slightly more complex instrument.

The simple rule is that if a share price moves away from a specific value by a specific time, you profit.

&amp;#x200B;

**Going long with a call option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb beyond $120 by November 5th, you may purchase the option to ""purchase a share - or call it into your wallet - for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price increases from $100 to $200 sometime between now and November 5th, you can exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price never hits $120, and instead falls to a November 5th price of $40, you aren't obligated to do anything; you can opt to eat the cost of the option. Here's what the option game looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

[

&amp;#x200B;

**Going short with a put option**

Given a share price of $100 that you expect to climb no higher than $120 by November 5th, you may buy the option to ""sell a share (or put it out of your wallet) for $120 at any point between now and November 5th"". If the price falls to a November 5th price of $40, you can then exercise your option for an $80 profit. If the price rockets up to $200, you're under no obligations and only have to eat the relatively small cost of the option.

Note that if the price never hits break-even, you're responsible for your loss of principal; it's not like there's no downside.

&amp;#x200B;

[

&amp;#x200B;

\---

Options and stocks are two different types of financial instruments that are traded in two different markets. The price that you pay for an option is determined by supply and demand, in the same way that the price of a share is determined by supply and demand. The supply and demand for an option is derived from the supply and demand of the underlying shares. This is why options are referred to as derivative instruments.

Here's what an option contract looks like:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Call Option`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $FOO`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $100`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $120 [""strike price""]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 100 [1 contract = 100 shares]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD [See Note]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract expires: November 5th [New!]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Option price: $200 [New!]`

&amp;#x200B;

Note: Once you hold an option, you can do three things with it: You can manually exercise it at any time before the expiry; it can automatically be exercised by the broker at expiry; you can sell the contract back into the market.

This ""smart contract"" lets us bet on price and time in a way that limits our losses and leverages our capital.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's look at an example using a real stock: Tesla.

Let's suppose that I have $10,000 that I would like to invest in Tesla, and that I'm so confident in Tesla that I'm willing to throw it all away on a highly leveraged, optimistic bet. $TSLA is currently trading at $221. I expect it to be far above $221 by Q4 2019. Here are my games:

&amp;#x200B;

**Game 1: Going long with stocks**

* I can buy 10,000 / 221 = \~45 shares
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of just over $221 since the ""price to play"" is simply the $5 trade commission that my broker charges me.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose $10,000.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 and I earn (400–221) \* 45 or \~$8,000 (or potentially much more - stocks have no time limits)
* My max loss is $10,000, or 100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~80%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Game 2: Going long with options**

It looks like the $225 December strike price will cost about $35 per share:

&amp;#x200B;

[

&amp;#x200B;

* I have the market power equivalent of 10,000 / 35 = \~285 shares, or just under 3 contracts. (partial contracts are not allowed, but for this example, let's suppose they are)
* My ""break even"" is at a share price of 221 + $35 option price = \~$256. If the price breaks $256 between now and December, I'm golden.
* Worst case is the stock tanks overnight and I lose the $10,000 option contract.
* Ideal case is the stock climbs to $400 by December and I earn (400–225) \* 285 or \~$50,000
* My max loss is $10,000–100% of my investment; my potential gain is \~500%.

&amp;#x200B;

Options magnify my potential reward while also magnifying the potential for losses; Tesla dipping 20% means I lose 100% of my principal.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my ""contract"", in this case:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;`Contract Type: Buy Call Option`  
&gt;  
&gt;`----------------------------`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Wallet ID: Mick Ronson`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Ticker symbol: $TSLA`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract creation: $221`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Price at time of contract execution: $225 [""strike price""]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Number of shares: 285`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Buying or selling: ""Buying"" [Buying a call option = long]`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract signed: Just now`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract executed: TBD`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Date contract expires: December 20th`  
&gt;  
&gt;`Option price: $10,000`

507,t3_c5jqx4,"This summer, I'm working with one of the largest Asset Management firms in the world. There was a senior panel recently, and the CEO, the Head of Asset Management, and a few other executives were in attendance. The head of AM and I went to the same university, and I stuck around after a while to speak with him, but he was in a rush and told me to email him. I went above and beyond and scheduled a 20-minute meeting with him, and he accepted. His energy on the panel was phenomenal and easily a majority of the interns favorite. I'm pretty good at conversation and never have to come too prepared with specific questions, but I was going to talk about some books/podcasts/documentaries, really anything that had a significant impact on him.   
What do you think I should ask?  
TLDR; meeting with Head of Asset Management for 20-30minutes. Any great questions that'll lead to a great conversation?"

511,t3_c5el1l,"I wanted to ask what you thought of my professor's strategy with brk.b options. I should mention that I am not planning on using it but am really just curious if this is a good strategy. It seems kind of risky to me. My professor uses Berkshire since it doesn't move as much compared to other stocks and it's also his main investment. Basically, he rents out his Berkshire shares as he wants to get the premium.

&amp;#x200B;

Now for how this works. Let's say the original purchase price was $175. You would write/sell options with a strike price of around $210. The options are short term (3 weeks). If you hit the strike price you would just make $35,000. If it doesn't hit the sp you would still get the premium.

I know one of the biggest problems with target funds is that they become too conservative too quickly. However, what about investing in a target fund that is well beyond the year you plan on retiring, so that your fund doesn't become too conservative too quickly?

560,t3_c4v3nz,"I'm trying to model the approximate return profiles of *world class* venture capital/PE/hedge funds (i.e., top 1% funds). The model includes three pieces: (i) probability; (ii) return multiple; (iii) scale at which investing can be done. (There's already lots of information online about IRRs; I'm trying to look at these categories from the probabilistic perspective of individual bets).  Do my assumptions look reasonable?

**Venture Capital/Angel.** A *world class* early stage investor can achieve the following return profile up until about a $1M check size. These investors tend to write many checks; most investments essentially go to zero, but a few return an enormous return to make up the difference.

| **Probability** | **Return Multiple** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 5%          | 1000x           |
| 95%         | 0x              |

**Private equity.** A rough model for the best PE shops (we can assume they are generalists moving from bull market to bull market) flipping companies on a 2-5 year horizon:

| **Probability** | **Return Multiple** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 30%         | 10x             |
| 50%         | 5x              |
| 10%         | 1x              |
| 10%         | 0x              |

up to $500M scale.

**Opportunistic hedge funds.** Hedge funds looking for assymetric bets at scale might be modeled as

| **Probability** | **Return Multiple** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 15%         | 15x             |
| 75%         | 1x              |
| 10%         | 0x              |

and they can do this reliably up to $10B of scale.

**Expected returns.** Using the above information, we can compile the following expected return profiles:

| **Investing Style** | **Expected Return**    |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Venture Capital | 50x @ $1M scale    |
| PE              | 5.6x @ $500M scale |
| Hedge Funds     | 3x @ $10B scale    |

563,t3_c4ukbp,"Hi all,  


I'm new to investing, and have read up a bit on index/mutual funds. A few people I know suggests to invest as much money as I can afford into mutual funds. Before I start dumping my money into them, I wanted to be certain on how exactly you make a profit, and the best way to go about doing so.   


With my basic knowledge on this subject, can anyone elaborate on how you actually make a profit aside from dividends?Would you recommend saving up money and buying x of shares all at once, or set up automated monthly payments and trickle buy a few share each month?  


I've read that having money in the market is always better, but for example: if you go the trickle method, and you bought 100 share at 1$. The stock goes up to 2$ per share. You made a 100$ gain, and it continues to stay at 2$. Now you're still buying more shares every month, 2$ each. Your average cost per share will slowly increase, which means you'll have a smaller profit margin each month. If every month you continue to buy at all time high, you'll eventually start to even out. Assuming no dividend payouts in this scenario, you won't actually be making a profit at all in the long run. So you actually would NEED the price to drop in order to profit?  


So in this scenario, time in the market isn't always better than holding off and buying when it's lower? Am I looking at this the wrong way? Thank you for any advice you can give."

A K-10 comes out and the price drops to 40 dollars in a week. The margin trader feels the stock will continue to fall and is in no rush to execute the option. The original owner of the stock (Client A) wants to sell the stock to cut his losses.

From what I'm understanding, the brokers have some stocks to float Client A's request to sell and not call back the stock it leant to the trader. But if the stock is plummeting... and keeps plummeting (like enron) do brokers ever execute a ""call"" on traders to return the stock they lent? 

I'm sure this situation is super common sense, but I can't find an easy answer on it.

So why do people buy shares and why do people pay more for them in the future when what you may actually receive is the same (0 such as with BRK.A).

586,t3_c40bb1,"I'm 25 and trying to put away as much money as I can. I have a Roth IRA and a 401k, but I also have some personal accounts I am paying attention to.

&amp;#x200B;

I have about 25k in Wealthfront (risk score 8) which is a mix of investments. I haven't seen great returns from it since I made it 2 years ago, but I have had decent tax loss harvesting. This year it has been doing fairly well though.

&amp;#x200B;

I recently started another portfolio on M1 with a lot of dividend based stocks/etfs/etf bonds which is a mix of about 60 stocks/etfs that will pay me about a 4-6% dividend return. That has been doing quite well for me so far, but it's been only a short time period.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm thinking of either doubling down on the wealthfront portfolio or M1 portfolio. Just moving the 25k from wealthfront to my M1 portfolio or the other way around. I am leaning towards moving the 25k in Wealthfront to M1, which would put me around 35k in M1. If I did this, I should be making about $140-160 a month (on average) which I believe would help me snowball a bit. I'm really looking to snowball my portfolio here, and I am now investing about $4-5k a month of extra income. I am fairly frugal and try to save where I can (without being miserable).

&amp;#x200B;

The stocks/etfs I have are fairly safe in my M1 account and are designed to be fairly resilient in a downturn economy. The idea is that I could be getting about $150 a month in dividends while I keep contributing to it, and then it eventually snowballs to the point where it could be making me $1k a month in dividends in about 2-3 years from now. If you're not familiar with M1, they do support fractional shares and will auto invest anything over $10. So I can set these dividends to be invested directly back into the account.

&amp;#x200B;

Wealthfront equity has been doing alright lately, but it seems that the second any economic BS hits, it's right back to where it started as if it has never appreciated at all.

&amp;#x200B;

What are your thoughts on this? Another benefit is that I am no longer paying the wealthfront fees (although low, can add up I'm sure). If anyone wants to see my M1 portfolio for passive income, I will post it below if anyone has critiques as well. I didn't design this portfolio, I based it on some other peoples portfolios and changed it a little bit to reflect my risk tolerance.

&amp;#x200B;

[

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Another option is that I could put the money into M1, but just copy my current Wealthfront portfolio. That way I keep the same holdings, but I'm not paying the management fee. The tax loss harvesting might be worth it to keep it with Wealthfront though."

#Five way to time your IRA contribution

Steve, Mike, Larry, Tom and Paul were college friends who graduated 40 years ago. On they day they graduated, they made a pact to max out their IRAs every year, starting in 1979. (It was a Traditional IRA back then as the Roth wasn’t introduced until 1997).

&amp;nbsp;

They continued contributing every year for 40 years from 1979-2018. Every year they maxed out their IRAs as allowed by the IRS. Over the years the IRS has changed that contribution limit as follows:

 * 1979-1981: $1,500
 * 1982-2000: $2,000
 * 2002-2004: $3,000
 * 2005-2007: $4,000
 * 2008-2012: $5,000
 * 2013-2018: $5,500

Maxing out their IRAs for those 40 years, each of the friends contributes a grand total of **$123,500** in cash.

#Save or Invest?

Steve had heard that the stock market was risky, so he decided to never actually invest his money and instead left it in a money market account inside of his IRA. The other four were ahead of their time and knew the power of buying and holding index funds. They all decided to invest 100% of their contributions in a single S&amp;P 500 index fund and never sell. But each had a different strategy about when to make the contribution and investment. Let’s see how they fared.

#Steady Saving Steve

Steve hated the thought of losing his retirement money and heard the stock market was risky. So every every month for forty years he would contribute 1/12th of the maximum allowable IRA contribution to his IRA and leave it invested in a money market account. (Basically an interest paying cash account). His account earned interest, which was a bit of a wild ride over the years since the interest rates were over 17% (wow!) for many months in the early 80s, but under 1% from 2009 through 2018. With his slow and steady saving and consistent interest, Steve’s nest egg never went down in value and grew to **$210,557** by the end of 2018.

#Monthly Maintenance Mike

Mike also contributed money once per month in equal amounts of 1/12th of the annual contribution limit. But instead of leaving it in a money market account, Mike always invested it in an S&amp;P 500 index fund. He left it alone and never sold anything. His monthly strategy grew his investment to **$1,045,129** at the end of 2018, beating Steady Saving Steve by 396%.

#Lump Sum Larry
Larry didn’t like waiting or making monthly transactions. So on the first day the market was open each year, Larry maxed out his IRA and invested it in his S&amp;P 500 index fund in a single lump sum. His lump sum strategy grew his IRA to **$1,109,386** at the end of 2018, beating Monthly Mike by 6.1%.

#Terrible Timing Tom

Tom also dumped all his money in at once each year, but he had the worst timing possible. Instead of buying a little each month or buying all at the beginning of the year, Tom invested the moment of the absolute peak of the market each year. For example. in 1987, he dumped all his money at the peak, right before Black Monday only to watch the value of his IRA drop by more than a third over the following few months. But he never sold, and stuck to his terrible timing for 40 years. His strategy netted him **$919,533** at the end, about 12% less than Monthly Mike made.

#Perfectly Precise Paul

Paul also dumped all his money in at once. But Paul was omniscient. He was only person on the planet that pinpointed the exact instant of the market low 40 consecutive years. And at that instant he optimized the potential value of his IRA by dumping every penny of the annual max contribution and happily watched it go up for the remainder of the year. Paul’s impossibly perfect precision earned him the most of any of the five friends: **$1,212,838**. Even with his ability to see the market bottom before it happened, he still only beat Lump Sum Larry by 9.3%.

#The Lesson

All four of our index fund buyers handily beat the savings account by well over 4x. They were wise to understand the power of buying and holding an index fund without worrying about the volatility of the market. Terribile Timing Tom and Perfectly Precise Paul showed that even the worst or best possible timing really doesn’t change things all that much. And the realistic strategies that Larry and Mike employed were pretty close, with Lump Sum Larry coming out slightly ahead.

&amp;nbsp;

So if you’ve got the cash, dump it all in on January 1st. If you like the idea of dollar cost averaging, set up auto-investments so it happens every month without having to look at it. But the important thing is to invest early and often! 🙂

A book I recently read is “The hard thing about hard things” I really liked how it flowed if you’ve read that and have books similar to that I’d love to hear.

Reason why I’m looking to invest is not to become a millionaire overnight but to not miss out on the next big thing or at least try to take a shot at something.

I have a question regarding how tax loss carryovers work.




EXAMPLE 1:
Assume I have a $5,000 short-term capital loss (STCL)
Assume I have a $8,000 long-term capital loss (LTCL)
Net capital loss is $13,000 for the year (sum of the two)


Is it true that I can only deduct a maximum of $3,000 as a net loss in this year, and then I have to carry forward $10,000? Of the loss that I can deduct, is it all first deducted from short-term losses, so then I have a $2,000 STCL carryover and a $8,000 LTCL carryover? For the following year, do I net short-term gains to my short-term loss carryover? And then long-term gains net to my long-term loss carryover?

Assume I have a $5,000 STCL
Assume I have a $6,000 long-term capital GAIN


Do I just end up paying $1,000 in long-term capital gains? Or do I take a $3,000 deduction from the STCL (net loss of $2,000), carry that over to the next year, and pay the long-term capital gain on the full $6,000?






Basically, are carryovers treated as such:
If you have more than $3,000 capital losses, deduct $3,000 first from short-term capital losses and then the remainder of that $3,000 from long-term capital losses
Carry forward the rest to the following year - keeping record of what is short-term vs. long-term carry forward
If you have long-term capital gains, you can net those against short-term capital losses and pay the tax rate on long-term capital gains (off the net, assuming you have more gains than losses)
If you have short-term capital gains, you can net those against long-term capital losses and pay that tax rate on the short-term capital gains (assuming you have more gains than losses)




Thanks for your help!"

&amp;#x200B;

From what I understand if the Fed reduces the size of the balance sheet (through Quantitative Tightening) then the effective level of the Fed's liquidity (reserves) also decreases. This reduces the power of the Fed to inject liquidity into the market by buying up assets? (But can't the Fed just ""expand the balance sheet"" again? By issuing more notes and using those notes to buy more securities? I'm guessing the issue is that the balance sheet can only be expanded so many times before hyper-inflation?)

&amp;#x200B;

Either way, what is the connection to the market? If the Fed can't buy up assets it might be unable to ""un-invert"" the yield curve? Which would cause the credit rating of the US to fall?"

I am an Australian and I've been thinking of making an overseas investment in Bali, Indonesia (North Bali to be precise). It's a property investment on a fractional ownership structure. There are a number of factors to consider but as the owner is also Australian and has a decent background I do 100% believe in the legitimacy of the project, so as far as being scammed goes, I am not worried.

The project is currently being constructed in North Bali and will be a large complex consisting of 30 or so villas. The company has a track record with 2 other similar properties in the area which run at 80% occupancy. As I understand it, I will buy a villa and they will manage it and rent it out to people on holiday. There won't be anythingfor me to do apart from buy the villa outright. As well as receiving the rental income after management fees, their is also entitlements available on the profits of the resort as a whole. Calculating everything they are guaranteeing a minimum 8% return on the investment with the possibility to make more and even use the villa for up to 4-weeks.

The biggest deterrent for me is that I will not own the property outright and with Indonesian laws not being welcoming to foreigner property ownership, I will actually only own it on a leasehold agreement of 25 years with a possible option to extend for another 20-years afterwards.

They have a variety villas available with the entry point being around 200k AUD. Before I put any serious efforts into attaining a villa I wanted to hear from anyone who has experience with any of the following.

1. Property investment in Bali
2. Fractional ownership property
3. Leasehold investment
4. Obtaining finance for an overseas investment

Adobe’s stock is up 22% so far in 2019 which is impressive given the fear led dips we've had.

657,t3_c3jinm,"Hello. I don’t even know if this topic is appropriate for this sub. 

So a little backstory, my father, owner and general contractor of construction company, and I, future contractor and architect, are looking to develop 12 lots on a parcel across the street from our house. But we do not know how to go about finding someone with the ability to partner on such a project. 

We know the owners, and back in 2000 my father developed a 19 lot neighborhood. Which we live in. Our  neighborhood is on the gulf near Tampa, 70 ft above sea level, 10 min drive to the water, 20 mins to the beach with nationally accredited schools. We hope to recreate the traditional craftsman style home with large front porches as we did previously [18” Birdseye view of our neighborhood ]( 

The property owner because he knew us, wanted to give us the first opportunity. We proceeded with preliminary plans, meet for a pre-application with the county. Reached out to civil engineers, but have hit stand still. With my parents having 4 children (they are good parents but we went to Disney one too many times lmao), we are not in a position to finance this project ourselves. 

We are currently looking at list price of $1.3m for the land, but believe we can get $1.1 to $1.15m. With an estimated $200-300k development cost. At 12 lots the hard cost is 125,000 per lot. Lot prices are selling at an estimated 140,000-185,000 per lot. Homes will be minimum 2,500 sq ft homes and starting around $570,000. With comps to justify pricing and demand. Other developments are 75-85% sold within the year of listing.  

We are seeking a partner to help finance this and expect to make their return with the sale of the lot, as we are not in a position to pay monthly. This is a risk all would undertake. all development and construction would be exclusively contracted through our company. All homes will be contracted and paid through construction loans by the owner.

More backstory on father. Started working overseeing construction of neighborhoods for US homes. Worked in commercial and residential construction for RJ Bunberry. Has had his own own custom home construction company since 97? (Might be off by a year or two). Now recently working for a company based of Detroit mostly dealing with commercial interior builds. Currently netting close to 35-40% of the company’s gross revenue single handily (very large national clients mind you), while not receiving recognition he deserves. I know he wants to focus on retirement. Working from home this project is in our backdoor, and I know he is beginning his own midlife crisis. I work with my father daily, and I just want to help his best interests. Just need to figure out how to get in communication with someone interested in developing. We have put together a packet too to express this a little clearer when we do have someone interested. 

tldr: need help how to find an investor for 1.5m to develop 12 new homes. Returns to be paid and based on sale of lots, an estimated approximate 15% return in 1.5-2years. We would be exclusive builder for these 12 homes.

669,t3_c3ave4,"It’s conventional wisdom to have a 2-3 fund portfolio as soon as possible—consisting of index ETFs and bond ETFs. Many people also recommend that you should contribute maximum amount to IRAs every year.

However, lets say you want to invest 12k per year. You will contribute 6k to IRA and 6k to a normal brokerage account. You are young so you want to pursue an aggressive 70-30 stock to bond portfolio. I assume most people would split 70-30 in both accounts, meaning you get 4200$ stock in IRA, 1800$ bond in IRA, 4200$ stock in brokerage account, and 1800$ bond in brokerage account.

Others may even say, I want my IRA to be less risky so let me contribute all bonds there, meaning 3600$ in bonds and 2400$ in stock in your IRA, and 6400$ stock in your normal portfolio. This way we maintain our overall 70-30 allocation.

However, due to the capital gains and interest, especially if you sell ETFs and perhaps buy and sell stock too, wouldn’t it be way smarter to have more stock in your IRA. That way any capital gains you make if you buy or sell, and if you’re using Roth, that income will be tax free for life. 

In fact, due to the fact you’re using a bond ETF you may even be free from state taxes by having more bonds as opposed to stock in your traditional portfolio. And even more so if you use municipal bonds. Am I missing something? Shouldn’t your IRA be the one where you do riskier things and try to get capital gains and earn higher stock-based dividends as opposed to being safer?"

I'll give an example. PG&amp;E. Everybody was screaming bankruptcy a few months ago, and was swearing off that they would be good as dead. Now, it's skyrocketing past $24 when only a few months ago it was $7. I was very close to purchasing $30k worth of shares at $7.3, but decided against it after I read the very strong opinions dissuading me on this sub. 

Another example. Bitcoin. I can't count the number of times that morons on this sub have said that Bitcoin is ""not an investment"" and is a ""bubble"". Everyone knows it fell to $3k literally months ago. Now it's over $10k, and may never be below $10k again. I was again, extremely close to purchasing $20k worth of Bitcoin at $3k, but the very strong opinions and arguments against Bitcoin on this sub again disuaded me. Another huge missed opportunity.

I have literally missed out hundreds of thousands of dollars in potential gains because most of you guys are idiots who shouldn't be providing advice to vulnerable people like me.

What websites are the most reputable to buy from?

I see that bullion and coins come in plastic packages, can I take them out of those or are they super important?

Also,  I see most websites have platinum and silver, are those something I  should look into now or later when I am more knowledgeable?

How do I get the best money from my gold when I decide to trade them in for cash?

Any tips or concerns to look out for?

&amp;#x200B;

Answers to one more multiple will be greatly appreciated!

Assuming you took the classic /r/investing advice of ""just buy SPY and wait"", you might have a lot of shares of SPY.

SPY is at about $295 right now.  Let's say you've been working and buying SPY for a few years.  So $29,500 would be 100 shares.  

A $295 SPY Put expiring 12/17/21 is $3,122.  For a little over $3k, you can protect your entire position.  

If that is too much to justify, the $270 Put expiring the same day is $2,119.  Sell this one to make a spread.  Now, you will only protect for a 9% drop, but a 9% drop is $2,655.  

Okay, so you have 100 shares of SPY because you've been following r/investing.  That's $29,500.  You can spend $1,003 to protect your investment from a 9% drop for **TWO AND A HALF YEARS**.  

That's all the Fed Rate Hike/Cut/Nothing (for 2 years), the election, Trump's Twitter, China Trade, etc.  

You can still buy SPY every paycheck, you know."

&amp;#x200B;


&gt;Mexico's Senate overwhelmingly voted for a broad rewrite of trade rules between the United States, Canada and Mexico-making the nation the first of the three partners to ratify the pact designed to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement.  
&gt;  
&gt;""Mexico takes the lead, with clear signs that ours is an open, market economy,"" Mexico's deputy foreign minister and chief trade negotiator for North America, Jesús Seade, tweeted following the vote.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We trust our partners will soon do the same for the sake of a strong North America, with clear rules, attractive for investment, stable and competitive."" U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer called Mexico's ratification of the agreement a ""Crucial step forward."" Mexican approval was welcomed at a time when its economy is in a sharp slowdown.  
&gt;  
&gt;""We applaud the Mexican government for advancing the process and we encourage the legislatures in the U.S. and Canada to finish the ratification."" Both Canada and Mexico began the process of seeking legislative approval of the pact in late May after settling a dispute with the U.S. over steel and aluminum tariffs.  
&gt;  
&gt;Mexico pressed ahead with the ratification despite the U.S. threat of imposing tariffs on all imports from Mexico if its southern neighbor didn't do enough to curb the flow of migrants crossing Mexico to the U.S. border.  
&gt;  
&gt;After a frantic week of meetings in the U.S. capital, an agreement was reached putting off the tariffs while Mexico took measures to reduce the number of mostly Central American migrants passing through the Latin American nation to the U.S. Mr. López Obrador insists he wants to avoid confrontation with the U.S., and has stressed the importance of the trade deal to Mexico, which sends 80% of its exports to the U.S. Mr. Trump has praised Mexico's crackdown on the passage of undocumented migrants, but has also kept open the possibility of applying tariffs in the future if he's not satisfied with the results of the Mexican measures.

754,t3_c25lfp,"(Bloomberg) -- The White House explored the legality of demoting Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell in February, soon after President Donald Trump talked about firing him, according to people familiar with the matter.

The White House general counsel’s office weighed the legal implications of stripping Powell of his chairmanship and leaving him as a Fed governor, the people said, in what would be an unprecedented move. A replacement would have to be nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate.

Trump’s team conducted the legal analysis and came to a conclusion that has remained closely held within the White House, the people said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. It isn’t clear whether Trump directed the legal review, and the people didn’t describe the outcome.

A White House official who declined to be identified said he wouldn’t comment on what he called alleged discussions from months ago. Trump’s top economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said demoting Powell isn't currently under consideration.

Fed spokeswoman Michelle Smith said in an email: “Under the law, a Federal Reserve Board chair can only be removed for cause.”

‘Stuck With You’

Bloomberg News reported in December that Trump discussed firing Powell out of frustration over the central bank’s interest rate increases.

While Trump still regularly expresses his displeasure with the Fed in tweets, talk of removing Powell has subsided. Trump told Powell in a March phone call, “I guess I’m stuck with you,” according to the Wall Street Journal.

The Federal Reserve Act provides explicit protection for all Fed governors against removal by the president except “for cause.’’ Courts have interpreted the phrase to require proof of some form of legal misconduct or neglect of basic duties. A disagreement over monetary policy wouldn’t meet that bar.

However, it’s less clear whether the president can demote a chair, removing him or her from that position while leaving the person as a Fed governor.

Scott Alvarez, who served as the Fed’s general counsel for more than a decade until 2017, said Powell could still be protected because of changes Congress made to the law four decades ago.

Up to that point, the president simply named the Fed chairman from among governors already confirmed by the Senate. But in 1977, lawmakers amended the act, requiring the Senate to confirm chair and vice chair nominees for four-year terms separately from the confirmation of their governorships, which run as long as 14 years.

Alvarez said the courts would likely interpret the 1977 change as removing not only the president’s unilateral authority to name the chair, but also the ability to dismiss him or her without cause. There is, however, no precedent for such a move and no way to know how the courts would rule if the Fed, or Powell himself, challenged the demotion.

Frustrated President

The White House legal team developed its analysis after Trump in December privately discussed firing Powell following an interest rate increase that roiled global financial markets. The Fed has raised rates seven times since Trump took office.

Fed policy makers are meeting Tuesday and Wednesday. No rate move is expected immediately, though economists and investors generally agree the central bank will cut borrowing costs this year.

Powell, who became chairman in February 2018, has drawn Trump’s ire for not being more accommodating of his trade war with China. The president has repeatedly complained that the Fed, under Powell, has stymied growth and financial markets by raising rates.

“He’s my pick -- and I disagree with him entirely,” Trump said last week in an interview with ABC News. “Frankly, if we had a different person in the Federal Reserve that wouldn’t have raised interest rates so much we would have been at least a point and a half higher.”

Trump had a casual dinner with Powell and Fed Vice Chairman Richard Clarida in February, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said at the time. The Fed released a statement shortly after the meeting saying that the group discussed the U.S. economy’s performance and outlook, but that Powell didn’t share his expectations for monetary policy.

‘Law Is Clear’

Powell told the CBS News program “60 Minutes” in March that he didn’t think it was appropriate to comment on Trump. But Powell also said he doesn’t think the president has the authority to fire him. “The law is clear that I have a four-year term. And I fully intend to serve it,” he said.

Currently, five of the Fed’s seven seats are filled, and Trump is weighing candidates for the other two seats. Trump has named four people for two seats on the Fed’s board of governors. None of them made it through the Senate.

By voicing his frustrations with the Fed, Trump breaks with at least two decades of tradition of presidents refraining from commenting on monetary policy. Presidents, however, have reportedly applied pressure on rates.

Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker recounted in a recent memoir that in 1984, President Ronald Reagan ordered him not to raise rates before elections. Former President George H.W. Bush urged Alan Greenspan to lower interest rates in a June 1992 interview with the New York Times.

Trump on Tuesday took his pressure campaign against central bankers to the European Central Bank. The president accused the euro area and China of weakening their currencies to gain an economic advantage, calling out ECB President Mario Draghi for pledging monetary stimulus just before the Fed meeting this week.

Draghi said at the institution’s annual forum in Sintra, Portugal, that “additional stimulus will be required” if the economic outlook for the 19-nation euro area doesn’t improve.

My pie link:  

I'm in my late 20's and leaving a well established ETF shop for a new job. I decided against a home purchase in next 3-5 years and have decided to keep renting with my partner. My 401k is with Fidelity. My Roth IRA is with Vanguard. Both are 80% equities 20% bonds. 

Since starting in April with M1, I've earned over $200 in dividends but I've gotten rather sick of the people who think it's all about dividends when young people should focus on growth fund indices/sectors (just my opinion). 

Previously I used to swing trade and found modest success but decided to stop that after a year - too stressful.  Previous to that I was just a hardcore saver and hadn't learned about the financial markets. 

Currently in M1, I've started selling portions of my stocks that were in the green and simply holding thousands in cash. 

I used to deposit $400 per week but I've dialed that down to $200 because there's nothing to buy in this market. I turned off auto-invest and target my bond funds (cash reserve pie), which is already too bloated. 

I'm essentially waiting on the sidelines. Waiting for a drop. I don't trust this market with all the bullshit going on with Unicorn IPO's, bond yield inversion, Trump tweets, corporate debt higher than ever before in history, tariff wars, etc. 

I wasn't invested during the previous recession so I don't know what it feels like to go thru something like that with real money. 

It appears most people are just excited about dividends here, but is anyone fearful? Anyone allocating similarly? Anyone got experience going thru a recession and how to allocate their portfolio?

TLDR: Auto-invest turned off. I'm manually targeting less risky assets for the time being. Nothing is on sale right now for me to buy. Anyone fearful like me in this market and have any suggestions/strategies for their pies?"

While the fed remained neutral, it has moved to an easing posture that makes cuts in July and/or September a distinct possibility. While the rate decision met the consensus market view, the updated dot plot reflects a very dovish take with seven members calling for 50bps in rate cuts by year-end.

In response, Treasuries are rallying across the curve as they see a Fed seemingly poised to start cutting. While the Fed had provided a dovish surprise at each of the three prior FOMC meetings, we surmised that the only way to pull that off today would have been with a rate cut, but alas, that was a bridge too far for Powell and Co., given still decent economic and labor market results.

Also of importance, the longer-run, or neutral, rate was cut from 2.75% to 2.50%. Powell has tried to wave-off the importance of the dot plots as it was born in a rising rate world, and as such is more unwieldy in projecting rate cuts via slowing/recessionary scenarios. That being said, the important takeaway today is that the Fed sees the hiking cycle as complete, and while they were hesitant to forecast aggressive rate cuts, there is no doubt they have shifted to an easing posture as the most likely next move. Finally, the vote was not unanimous. James Bullard voted to go ahead with a 25bps cut at this meeting.

Overall, it's very evident that a rate cut is near and thus the rally today."

Beyond Meat's post-IPO rally surges to more than 680% as short sellers lose hundreds of millions (BYND)

Leanna Garfield/Business Insider
Beyond Meat gained more than 15% in pre-market trading Tuesday.
The jump in shares extended a rally from news of a newly announced ground beef product and shortages of the Impossible Burger. 
Short sellers have lost hundreds of millions of dollars betting against shares of the plant-based meat alternatives company as its shares have rallied.
Watch Beyond Meat trade live.
How high will Beyond Meat go?
Shares of the plant-based meat alternatives company ballooned more than 15% in pre-market trading Tuesday, continuing a run on news of a new ground beef product and potential shortages from a major competitor.
The stock is now sitting around $197 per share, nearly eight times the IPO price of $25. That's a 688% gain since the IPO in early May.

The company confirmed Monday that its new plant-based 'ground beef' product will be available in grocery stores starting June 24, which sent shares up as much as 10%. That headline extended a rally from Friday, when a report that restaurants Red Robin and White Castle had experienced shortages of Impossible Burgers, a major competitor to Beyond's burger.
Short sellers have absorbed losses totaling $560 million during the stock's meteoric rise, through Monday's close, according to data-analytics firm S3 Partners.
Those betting against the stock have had to grapple with extreme borrowing fees as it became more expensive to short the stock than to own it, an 'extraordinarily rare' situation according to Ihor Dusaniwsky, the managing director of predictive analytics at S3."

&gt; Last week, US senators and representatives introduced bills in the Senate and the House to open up a type of corporate structure originally reserved for oil, gas, and coal companies to clean energy companies.

&gt; Called a Master Limited Partnership (MLP), the structure currently allows fossil fuel companies to take advantage of lower taxes placed on limited partnerships while also allowing those companies to issue publicly traded stocks and bonds. If the recently re-introduced bills—which have bipartisan support in both the House and the Senate—pass their respective votes, clean energy companies would have the option to structure their companies as MLPs and take advantage of the tax and funding benefits.

It's going to be interesting to see if yieldcos (e.g. Nextera Energy Partner, CWEN, Pattern Energy) switch to MLPs should those bills pass, and if other utility/energy companies would also consider running MLPs."

Intel - Since their main competitor is making new processors which are in theory much stronger and power efficient, this could result in their stocks gown down which means getting them for a cheaper price.

795,t3_c2iu4o,"So I was recently thinking about this, and I feel like people buying index funds so they CAN’t ‘underperform’ might be wrong.  Sure, we cannot predict future returns of value stocks, growth stocks, momentum stocks, low volatility stocks or any other factor.  And for most people, the best thing to do is probably to go with the funds with the lowest fees, since the only known variable is fees, which reduces return.  However, I don’t think the fear of underperformance is a valid reason to own index funds.

For example, I could buy RSP (Equal-weighted S&amp;P500 ETF) and a lot of people would consider this active investing.  But 1. It follows an index and 2. It follows a rules-based model (there’s no manager picking stocks).  To me, it seems way more passive than the Dow Jones that is price-weighted.  So other than CNBC showing the S&amp;P 500 every day, is VOO really more passive than RSP?  Sure, both ETFs overweight large stocks and RSP has a higher turnover, but indices don’t have to market-cap weighted.  The same thing that’s told about the S&amp;P 500 could be said about RSP: ‘About 90% of active fund managers underperform a simple equal-weight S&amp;P 500 ETF’.   What is the difference between saying ‘I buy VUG, because most growth fund managers underperform growth index funds’ and ‘I buy VOO, because most fund managers underperform the S&amp;P 500’?

Also, considering the fact that a lot money flows into market-cap weighted index funds, couldn’t this investment style become overcrowded and underperform most other investment styles in the future (like Value recently)?  I don’t know if it will happen, But I believe it could.  So that’s why I think that, for some (if not most) investors, having exposure to different factors could reduce volatility, encourage them to stay the course (the underperformance of one factor will be less painful) and could also increase return with rebalancing.  It's also worth noting that most of the people on this sub already have an active portfolio by being 100% US stocks"
797,t3_c2c0hk,"Today I took profits out from my portfolio. Here is how I approached it.

Portfolio has been slowly building over the last 5 years, so yea I’ve made a bit of money like anyone invested over that time period. Portfolio is heavy on tech and banking.

1) Take profits from any investment that is up at least 20%.

2) For any positions where I am ‘long’ sell 50% of whatever my gain is. For example if the position is up 40%, sell 20% of the total position.

3) For any positions where I am expecting returns in the short term but don’t plan to hold, I withdrew my principle and now just have the gains in play.

4) For all others I set a stop limit that triggers if the position falls to +5%. At the point I dump the entire position.

Cash sits on the sideline in a 2.5% APR account waiting for a better entry.

I’m sure I didn’t get out at the top with most of these, but it feels nice to take some profit.

My question is,  when do I get out? Should I get out this afternoon because tomorrow one of the 3 priced in rate decreases could be for-shadowed or even announced?

I’m about to make my first investment in a mutual fund and I’m not sure which direction I should go because I don’t understand what the risks actually are. Overall I consider myself a below average risk tolerance but that might be different with investing. As a lower risk person I do not have the tolerance to bet big and lose all my money or a significant chunk. However, I can withstand volatility to a very high degree knowing it overall means greater returns if I hold out, I would never sell in a panic, especially investing money that I have no time table to pull out on. 

I looked through some sorted by 10 year gains and they all appear to be riskier growth funds. The problem is I don’t know if I’m not seeing a bunch of growth funds that absolutely tanked or if that even happens to growth funds over long terms. Also I think the 10 years leaves out any recessions so they probably are very favorable over that time period. 

So what is my risk tolerance for investing? If I have unlimited flexibility on pull out date, should I just be going for growth funds at this point? If I do, how prepared should I be for ending up with a net loss if I never panic sell?"

Just today I was reading Trump’s criticism of Mario Draghi’s financial stimulus programme and there are many layers and issues that escape me. I don’t understand certain points being argued about. And this lack of knowledge makes me nervous about the fact I want to start investing large amounts of my hard-earned money. 

That being said, I feel as though the principles of investing in index funds and ETFs are pretty straight-forward and doesn’t require much thought from me outside of adequate diversification and proper fund selection.

It’s bought some stock in marijuana companies though, and I think in a couple years it would be *possible* for the stock to turn around and become appreciating.

I know all the other metrics used to drive stock price along with growth etc but when I compare EPS and P/E ratios of MU with other stocks in same sector it doesn't make much sense as it's EPS is pretty high and P/E pretty low.

832,t3_c24eqe,"Ok, I am VERY confused. I'm a n00b here so please be patient.

Two weeks ago, I bought 5 vertical calls for BYND that expire on Aug 16, 2019. Note I bought both legs as a ""vertical call"" strategy.
- Bought 5 BYND 100 calls expiring on Aug 16
- Sold 5 BYND 110 calls expiring on Aug 16

Net cost was $3.14/call. So I paid 5 x 100 x $3.14 = $1,570.

TODAY, I got a notification that I am in margin call on my Questrade account - when BYND was trading at around $178.

I saw that Questrade had sold bought back 3 of the 110 calls I was short, so...I now have ""-300"" shares of BYND and ""-2"" 110 options. The agent said that because I had a leg that was ""short"", someone had recalled those options, forcing me into a margin call.

How/why did this happen, when I did not initiate any transaction? I was under the impression that because I bought a 100/110 vertical call, that I would have been profitable - so why did Questrade sell those 110 calls and force me into a margin call situation? Please help me understand.

""Davide Campari-Milano S.p.A. is the Parent Company of Campari Group. It operates directly on the Italian market and, through its subsidiaries, on the international alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages markets.""

But if we use the financial information for the parent company, which is on a much smaller scale than of the group, the PE ratio is above 50x, and EBITDA ratio is almost 50x as well. All the analyses I see on Campari states that the PE ratio is about 33x, which would be a good fit, if we use the financial information for the group, but is that the right way about it? Can we use the financial information of the group when it appears to me that we aren't buying the group, but rather, the parent company?

836,t3_c23xm0,"I used to plan to wait for a recession to invest until I read an article about a hypothetical situation where someone over about 30 years invested at the absolute worst time (day before recessions) and still turned 184k into 1.1 million because they never pulled out. Now I’m pretty firm on not trying to time the market because in the end you will make good money just sitting tight.

I had this other idea though that might already be a strategy and was wondering how viable it was. Instead pulling money in and out, what if you just stayed in but the amount you contribute throughout decreases. Instead of staying at let’s say $200 a month gradually decrease that amount and putting the rest in an account that you have access too at any moment. When the recession inevitably hits you start to ramp back up your contributions with that extra cash you started putting away during a bull run. I don’t have exact numbers or times on how this would work but is it a good strategy?

841,t3_c22o9s,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

For the past 2 years now I really feel like I've taken the ""red pill"" when it comes to the way the economy, financial markets and money itself work. 

to quote [wikipedia](

&gt;**Red Pill**:  A life of harsh knowledge, desperate freedom, and the brutal truths of reality.     
&gt;  
&gt;**Blue Pill**:  A life of luxurious security, tranquil happiness, and the blissful ignorance of the harsh realities of life, basking in an (essentially dishonest) illusion.  

It's no surprise then that I get most of my information these days from investors the likes of John Mauldin, Mike Maloney, Harry Dent, Peter Schiff, ... and Jim Rickards. Being fully aware of the risks this poses of getting lost an Echo chamber and feedback loop; I always try to 1) fact check as much of their claims as possible (up to the degree possible by someone without a phd in finance) and 2) still check traditional media regularly, if for no other reason than to put my own belief systems to the test.

It's that process of fact-checking and trying to remain critical of my own beliefs above all, that leads me to writing this post about Jim Rickards, because I can't seem to make up my mind about this guy.

Yes, his track record is amazing, and yes when he talks he really does sound like he knows what he's talking about (although granted you could say the same of any central bank board member, and I would discard the latter as Wizards of Oz without a qualm).

These past weeks, however, if noticed he has been promoting some daring claims (not implying that preeching Economic Apocalypse for a decade now is not ""daring"").

**The ""flatline"" formula**

the first was a claim through the Harry Dent newsletter, sent last week around june 12th, that he found a way to predict up to 24 hours ahead of time when a certain company stock would crash (the stock 'flatlining' i think he called it). I usually ignore the clickbaity get-rich-quick mumbo jumbo (unfortunately 95% of his letter, a first red flag), but I did find his claim intriguing: some sort of mathematical formula that predicts a single stock crashing. He even went as far as saying he had identified the next company who's stock would crash in the next 24 hours, which meant you'd be an absolute retard if you thought about the offer to much instead of instantly screaming ""shut up and take my money"" ! (a second red flag).

Unfortunately (third red flag) he wouldn't disclose his formula, and neither would he share the name of the company unless you bought something (subscription to his newsletter; roughly $1000 per year). In fact the idea of first introducing a problem and then selling your product x as magical solution to the problem you just introduced has become a red flag in and of itself lately.

The fifth red flag stems from pure common sense; why in the heck would he bother in trying to sell his product and make other people rich charging peanuts (relatively speaking); when he could just as easily use his magical formula himself and make gazillions (probably).

Three strikes and you're out; so I didn't buy into it. I did however commit to closely watching stocks the days after and correct me if i'm wrong but I found zero stocks that would qualify as a ""flash crash"" (e.g. sudden 40-50% decline, regardless of company performance).

So Question one: did anyone buy into it? And if you did was it worth it? Was he actually right in identifying a crash? And most importantly did you manage to make money out of it?

**Get out of cash and bonds**

Just today, He sent a newsletter (copying the [click-through link]( here; although I've downloaded a hard copy in case his ""offer"" goes offline) in the same fashion: The ""global elites"" of the IMF are supposedly up to something big as of june 30th 2019. The letter triggered the same red flags (get-rich-quick, move fast and buy my beautiful product or face the apocalypse), and although the details were again behind a paywall, this time he did seem to give a truly verifyable concept: supposedly the IMF will have implemented a Distributed Ledger by ""mid 2019"", in order to make their SDR as the new world currency.

I truly invite everyone to join me in the coming weeks to keep a close eye on whatever the IMF is doing, so we can once and for all see whether Mr. Rickards is a genius or a lunatic (thin line and probably bit of both, granted). Needless to say I will not take up his offer so I for one do not know what his actual strategy is. 

Some comments i already have (there are many...)

* why the hell is he simultaneously trying to promise you a $1000 a month return while at the same time basing his premise on the fact that the $ will become worthless.
* again, if he's got deep-state contacts and connections up to his neck, why is he wasting his time in tryoing to sell a monthly investment letter to small town folks. 
* why does he publish a [letter]( 8 days ago of a coming storm in fall 2019, but fails to mentions jack shit about the IMF or any of their plans?
* why does he end above letter with the claim:

&gt; The only safe harbors will be gold, cash and Treasury notes. 

* only to claim a few days later that 

&gt;It will impact your IRA or 401(k)… Checking and savings account… And any **cash** you have parked in the US financial system.

* and

&gt; With the globalist currency replacing the dollar, **demand for Treasury bonds will dry up** 

...

Have to admit that after writing this post I'm wondering why I'm putting any faith in the guy when all the above so blatantly points toward him being a scam/con artist.

Let's take AMD as an example.  As you can see from the link above, the trailing PE ratio is 117 vs the forward PE ratio is only 29.  So I'm going to make a few statements and as a few questions.  If those statements are incorrect please correct me.

- PE is price per share / earning per share.

- Trailing PE is the more accurate number of the two because it is based on the past 12 months.

- Forward PE is the inaccurate number because it tries to predict performance for the next 12 months.

- In the case of AMD the forward PE is lower because analyst is expecting AMD to perform much much better?  It's a growth business?  Analyst is expecting earning to go up.  Thus earning per share number will be bigger thus forward PE will be lower.  Is this correct?

- Since the trailing PE is so high, for AMD, that mean their earning has not catch up to their stock value.  Right now, based on AMD price, is valued for future growth and not actual current performance.  So right now, AMD is over valued and the stock price is higher than needed.  Is this correct?

- In the case of Intel, trailing and forward PE is practically the same, forward PE is slightly lower.  Thus analysts are predicting that Intel will grow, but the company will grow very slightly.

Just recently closed out a corporate bond position, leaving me $15.2k sitting idle.

&amp;#x200B;

Other positions:

Liquid: \~ $164k taxable account, $5k high yield savings, $31k in cash, as well as significant cash segregated from these.

&amp;#x200B;

Illiquid: $10.7k in owned unsecured personal loans (as in they owe me), $18.5k in fundrise, \~$71k Traditional IRA (not eligible for Roth sadly).

&amp;#x200B;

I would like to move towards owning my own physical rental properties, but have some questions

1. How much startup capital would I want to have
2. How could I go about finding markets to invest in (currently in Boston, real estate is more expensive here than I'd like and therefore am interested in investing elsewhere).
3. Any tips for how to research potential investment properties?

877,t3_c1nqhd,"I am trying to understand how important growth is to a company, and what should happen theoretically to a company that is not growing.

&amp;#x200B;

Lets say Company A has a dividend of $X/share that at the current market cap is returning all earnings, 4.5% back to shareholders at the current share price.

&amp;#x200B;

If Company A is staying completely constant, the earnings are constant, cash flow is constant every year, dividend is constant, what would happen? Would this be a decent investment, assuming no risks? Would the company be in trouble? Obviously it is returning less than the market average of 10% every year, so would the market cap naturally adjust to meet this 10% return?

&amp;#x200B;

I understand some of the reasons why growth is important, but I have some investments that have relatively no growth but decent cash flows and am trying to understand at what point they could become a buy.

&amp;#x200B;

Can a company with a constant return and no growth ever be a good investment/be able to survive as a company? And at what multiple of return or earnings would it be a buy?"

899,t3_c1mzfm,"Everyone I talk to about money and investing is so excited about the dividends their stocks, ETF's and mutual funds pay every three months.  Most of them don't reinvest their dividends and withdraw the money and spend the proceeds as mad money.  (Much like they view their federal and state income tax refund as also mad money.)

I try to explain to them that the payment of a stock dividend is more of an accounting gimmick than anything else. I tell them the stock price of the investment will drop an equal amount of the dividend the night before the dividend is paid.  So if you reinvest the dividend you have more shares but the same amount of money.  If you cash out the dividend payment and spend it on some mad money purchase you now have less money in the investment account. The stock value is less and you have fewer shares but you may be taxed on the dividend payment.

When I tell them this, no one believes me and they say the dividend payments are income, extra money much like bank interest. My comments about this fallacy are dismissed out of hand.

I also tell them that most investments with a high dividend yield won't give the total return of a TOTAL STOCK MARKET FUND.  This is also rejected.

&gt; Broadcom Inc sent a shockwave through the global chipmaking industry on Friday with its forecast that U.S.-China trade tensions and the ban on doing business with Huawei Technologies would knock $2 billion off the company’s sales this year. 

&gt; Huawei accounted for about $900 million, or 4%, of the company’s overall sales last year. Broadcom, however, also said the forecast cut “extends beyond one particular customer.” 

&gt; LONDON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Broadcom Inc sent a shockwave through the global chipmaking industry on Friday with its forecast that U.S.-China trade tensions and the ban on doing business with Huawei Technologies would knock $2 billion off the company’s sales this year.

&gt; The Philadelphia chip index was down nearly 3% with 29 of its 30 components trading lower. Shares of other Huawei suppliers like Analog Devices Inc, Skyworks Solutions and Qorvo Inc also fell.

&gt; “We’ll see a very sharp impact simply because (there are) no purchases allowed and there’s no obvious substitution in place,” Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said on a post-earnings call with analysts on the Huawei ban.

&gt; Huawei accounted for about $900 million, or 4%, of the company’s overall sales last year. Broadcom, however, also said the forecast cut “extends beyond one particular customer.”

&gt; “We’re talking about uncertainty in our marketplace, uncertainty because of the - of demand in the form of order reduction as the supply chain out there constricts - compress, so to speak,” Tan said.

&gt; The semiconductor industry has been grappling with slowing demand since the second half of 2018 with bellwether Texas Instruments warning in April that a cyclical downturn could last for another two years. 

&gt; “It’s not just Huawei, it’s deeper than that. OEMs [carmakers] aren’t ordering. Inventory concerns, which were supposed to ease, have not gone away,” said one European trader. “Goodbye H2 recovery hopes!” 

&gt; “We believe Broadcom’s 2H19 outlook is not only impacted by the direct Huawei export ban, but also includes the indirect impact from the Huawei export ban to other customers as well as the possible industry-wide impact of the possible additional import tariffs,” Summit Insights Group analyst Kinngai Chan said. 

&gt; Finisar Corp, which makes sensors for facial recognition, transceivers and other components for telecommunication networks, said in a regulatory filing that ban on Huawei could have continuing negative impact on its future revenue. Huawei represented 10% of its total revenue in fiscal 2019. 

&gt; The CEO of chipmaker Micron Technology also said the ban on Huawei brings uncertainty and disturbance to the semiconductor industry.

927,t3_c1ajgt,"First of all, this whole ""just buy the index and dollar cost average over a lifetime - you can't lose brah; no one can beat the market"" is really poor advice. Index funds, on the mutual fund side and ETF side, are relatively new structured products. 

Within the next three to five years, passive investing will make up more than 30% of all domestic assets in the US - dominated by three firms: Vanguard, BlackRock, StateStreet. Let me tell you right now! When a significant portion of investors believe that they can just throw money at something, assuming that over the long haul it will always go up, they get screwed royally.

Remember mortgage backed securities? Yeah, they were just a shit ton of mortgages bundled with other mortgages as a single security - everyone has a mortgage right? People aren't going to stop buying houses right? ""These MBS will always be a sound investment""

ETFs are not, by any means, simple products! There is a ton of behind the scenes ""kind for kind"" transactions taking place between fund providers and investment bankers - and when I mean a ton, I mean a fuck ton. Goldman Sachs is waiting for stock XYZ from fund ABC at price 123 so that it can fulfill ""kind for kind"" transaction with fund DEF. Everyone should read this article - it explains very thoroughly how ETFs work and with cool diagrams (

Liquidity Vacuum! Your ETF is fucked - And...your ETF provider more than likely has a legal provision allowing it to sell funds, sometimes up to 10-15% of funds in the separate account in the event of hard times. Yes, funds that make up the value/price of your ETF.

I'm not against ETFs or passive investing as a whole - both products and the overall strategy have made investing much more accessible/straightforward for the common man.

However, you need to know what you own! Quit throwing your cash at the wall and assuming it will stick. Buy mutual funds, buy ETFs, buy individual stocks, buy individual bonds, buy private real estate, buy public real estate. Diversify your structured products in addition to allocation within products.

On another note - I can name many funds that have beat the market within the past bull cycle. So don't let anyone tell you that financial fundamentals and top quality bottom up quantitative analysis doesn't produce results. Few and far between, but nonetheless.

EDIT: sheesh people, know what you own is the point of this post. I'm not bashing Indexing or ETFs - as I stated in the original post, they have accomplished a lot of great things for the common man.

Why assume we will bounce right back, when we could move sideways for years, or decades, after the next downturn, and break the 100+ year pattern of boom and bust that gives everyone so much confidence in long term investing. What if we are nearing the limits of rapidly accelerating technological gains, our deficit continues to balloon, and other unknown factors present headwinds to the US economy for a large majority of our investing lifetimes. It has happened in other countries, other asset classes, why not US stocks?"
930,t3_c12xrc,"If I understand it right, there is a window often between when company pays a dividend and when it is actually received or credited to your account/DRIP’d (the ex-dividend date and payment date). In this period, you are technically entitled to receive the dividend but often don’t get it until the payment date (which can be a month or so later). My question is, wouldn’t this put dividend paying stocks at a disadvantage relative to non-dividend payers, since that dividend money sits outside of your control (and this ability to collect interest on it) for a few weeks?"
931,t3_c0yzg7,"I am right now in the process of setting up my retirement plan and was looking into Bond ETFs as one of my investment vehicles (next to stocks and Real Estate Investment Trusts). I would prefer an ETF which reinvests the dividends to defer taxes (no 401k-like option available). This category of Bond ETFs exists, but they do not mature. That means, when selling my assets at some point the gain solely relies on the current Stock value of the underlying index. Depending on the current correlation between stocks and bonds at that time this can mean I lose money if both are down (positive correlation). Or in short, not an ideal hedging strategy.  


What I would prefer is a Bond ETF structure that reinvests into Bonds but still matures at a given time (buying new bonds which mature at the specified date). Thus, I would defer taxes and still get the money I put in back.  


Why isn't there such a structure? Would it be to expensive (fees too high)? Or do I oversee something here and this kind of ETF isn't needed?"

Today everyone is screaming to invest in index ETFs. People argue to not even think about it, to just do it. In general I think not thinking about your investments is a bad idea. If we look at the last 30 years of the Japanese NIKKEI, it's been trading sideways for that timeframe, even down a little.

Overall I have held on to my shares because the company overall has been very well managed from a business perspective. They are a juggernaut in the healthcare sector and continue to be successful in expanding into new markets via M&amp;A.

That being said I acknowledge there is a lot of risk with regulatory reform in the next 18 to 24 months. How severe the degree of reform is I don't know but personally I don't believe it will be extreme as M4A despite my support for it.

Unlike Disney, Netflix has not broken out of its sideways range yet, so it’s definitely going to take a meaningful break below that 200 DMA to raise a red warning flag on the stock. If it does indeed break below that line, investors may consider swapping out of that name and moving into Disney

951,t3_c0qaxb,"I'm an American with a Roth IRA mostly invested in a target date fund. I'm very far off from retirement so 90% of the fund is invested in stocks. Breaking this out, 50% is invested in US stock and 40% in international equity. Curious if retirement funds have a similar break out in other countries. Or do they follow the same pattern and invest in their own country first and others second? It makes some sense to me that US equity could make up the largest portion of foreign retirement funds as the US still has one of the most dominant stock markets. However, if an individual in the UK were to tell me their fund was 50% invested in British companies and 40% in international (where a portion of that is US equity), then I would feel worse about my portfolio allocation. Is there some sort of bias to bet on your own country first even when there may be greater opportunity elsewhere? By the time I retire it is highly plausible that another country has overtaken the US in economic and political power (China, India, etc). We all want to get the greatest return on our investments so you'd think fund allocation between countries would be relatively the same. If it's not it makes me think there's a bias I need to correct for."

&amp;#x200B;

Context:

I attended an investing event featuring Kevin O'Leary talking about his success in business ventures and investing money. Being that I am 20 Years old I was very interested in going as it was a free event to attend. Now at the event, there were 3 speakers who spoke about different areas where people have made their money. One from Real estate, one for Stocks and trading and Kevin himself. I was particularly interested in the stock marketing workshop through the Company Interactive Trader. Of course, its one of those things that you spend money up front, get it for a discount and so forth. I have always been interested in getting into the Stock market but have no experience in the area and wanted some direction. I figured, for the $300 (Normally $1000 from what I have read online), to get some idea of what I am getting into, the worst that can happen is that I wasted the money and know better for next time. You were also allowed to bring a guest for free and ended up going with my mother.

&amp;#x200B;

They structure it over the course of 3 days.

Day 1 - Get everyone very excited as they teach you about Options such as calls, puts, Futures ect.

Day 2 - You begin to break these things down into understanding how the above work and how to make money off them in good and bad markets. As well as Upselling the different ""class options"" with the Top class costing $25,000 (Yea... I know). They have you bring in some of your financial documents to assess where you are and ask to pull a soft credit score.

Day 3 - (Not taken yet) Tomorrow we will be learning some more in-depth information.

&amp;#x200B;

At this class, we were presented to my mother and I were hooked. The excitement of how much money could be made was great. I felt very informed about the information presented and I felt well taken care of. But I have my woes.

&amp;#x200B;

Research:

I've done a bit of digging on it finding many different things online and doing a bit more in depth on the company and if they are actually a legit company offering education. I found online that they are reviewed highly on a lot of iffy websites, one specifically Trust Plot where they have a direct link from their website and other blogs. Although they are quick to respond to bad reviews, they have all come from people who have only attended this 3 Day workshop. None that I can find are any testimonies from people who have actually gone through any other higher level courses. I also read that they contract out their one-on-one advisors, and that "" We do not hold ourselves out as a real estate broker, **registered investment advisor** or licensed securities broker, dealer or firm. We do not have any securities, insurance, or investment advisor licenses. We are not a licensed real estate broker; state **or federal registered investment advisor; licensed securities broker; dealer; agent or introducing broker; tax accountant;** or law firm. Some of the company’s hired presenters, trainers, and staff may hold various registration and licensing, but they do not operate in such capacity, as agents of the company. ""

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

The reason, why I am asking, is that my mom, who has some money and nearing retirement, is very serious about going signing up for their top-level class **TOMORROW** costing $25,000 which is a LARGE number to swallow, but believes this would be the best way to become a well-rounded trader and good way to manage their money for the future.

Now, they Brand themselves as an education company and I do think they have something good to offer, but am afraid of letting my mom make such a risk to though that amount of money at something and at a company that I can not find enough legit information to confirm my suspicion. 

If you could help me diagnose this or help me find another community to help it would be IMMENSELY Helpful! Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

I apologize if this is not the optimal place to post this, but figured people here might have some insight into companies like Interactive Trader and help me to a guided decision if this is a good idea.

I maxed out my Roth IRA, and it seems like I still have the same amount of stocks of VTSAX.
