&amp;#x200B;

But I'm sure everyone has been cucked before on MU, NVDA, AMD, NKE, BBBY, AVGO etc based on their ***forward guidance****.* You can be right about the earnings/points move, but if you don't account for the forward guidance of the statement, you will see your small gain go bigly into the red. This is exactly why every Fed meeting now has a press conference, because the Fed knows at the zero lower bound, talking and jawboning is much more effective than actually moving the fed funds rate or whatever other tool. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, in these few weeks up to the Fed, listen to their guidance. Look for any trial balloons they put out (they most likely will be hawkish to gauge market reaction). Fed will 99.9% sure cut 25, so stop guessing will they/won't they. They are stuck between a rock and a hard place right now.

68,t3_c9vpbi,"Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 8th, 2019.

# **The week ahead: Powell’s testimony could make or break the stock rally  - [(Source)](
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has the opportunity to reinforce market expectations for a late July rate cut or rein them in when he speaks to Congress in the week ahead.
*****
&gt; Powell testifies before the House Financial Services Committee Wednesday and at the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, and is expected to answer questions on the economy and Fed policy.
*****
&gt; His testimony comes after a strong June jobs report raised questions about whether the Fed will actually cut rates this month. The U.S. economy added 224,000 jobs last month, easily topping a Dow Jones estimate of 165,000. The report sent the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield back above the key 2% level. The dollar also rallied against a basket of currencies, pressuring commodities like gold.
*****
&gt; The report was “stronger than expected, but with an accompanying -11k in revisions the job gains were nothing to derail the Fed’s anticipated cut in 26 days,” Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note. The Fed next decides on rates on July 31.
*****
&gt; In the coming week, the market also has other places to look for clues on Fed policy, including in the Fed’s minutes from its last meeting, after which it suggested it could cut rates if it needs to. Those minutes are released Wednesday afternoon. There is also important consumer price index inflation data Thursday and producer level inflation data on Friday, when PPI is reported.
*****
&gt; But Powell’s comments to Congressional committees could clarify whether the Fed is on course to cut interest rates later this month, as widely expected.
*****
&gt; “It’s not clear to me the data are going to create a screaming case one way or the other. What it comes down to, is the Fed able to validate the market’s dovishness here?” said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpoint. “The one thing that has characterized Fed communications over the last month or six weeks is they’re just not willing to commit to anything ahead of time.”
*****
&gt; Hopes for a rate cut have sent bond yields lower and supported stocks this week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite hit all-time highs. The tech sector rose more than 1% to a record as well, while the communications services sector surged more than 2%.
*****
&gt; Economists say the markets would see a violent swing if Powell doesn’t stay on track for a rate cut. The fed funds futures market is pricing in one full quarter point rate cut and a little more for July.
*****
&gt; “I personally don’t see the case for an ease right now,” said Stanley. “Do they passively accept the market’s verdict or do they push back, in that they’re not fully on board with an ease right now? It would be easy to realign the market’s expectations. Powell speaks next week and that would be the perfect opportunity if they were so inclined.”
*****
&gt; Stanley said such a move would upset the stock market and weaken financial conditions, something the Fed would not want to do. But there is not a unanimous view about interest rate moves on the Fed either. Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester said this week that rates should be kept where they are for awhile. On the other hand, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard dissented at the June meeting because the Fed did not cut interest rates.
*****
&gt; Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, said a change in tone from Powell would be disruptive and unlikely. “There are other people trying to figure out what is the right thing to do right now, and there’s no easy answer,” said Swonk. “Jay Powell has made up his mind, and he doesn’t want to be on the wrong side of a recession.”
*****
&gt; Swonk said she expects the Fed to cut interest rates by a quarter point at the end of the month. “All you need is uncertainty. You’ve got that. You need inflation running low. You got that. You need wages not accelerating rapidly. You’ve got that,” she said. “You’ve got all these things lining up.”
*****
&gt; Some economists expect a half point cut, but Swonk said that would be too much since the Fed does not really have a lot of ammunition, given that the fed funds rate range is 2.25 to 2.50%. “They want insurance, but they don’t want to give away the house,” she said.
*****
&gt; Besides the Fed, investors will begin to think second quarter earnings season in the week ahead. Pepsico is a big name releasing its report Tuesday, ahead of the flood of reports from banks and others in the following week.

# Jumbo First Half Gains Usually Continue After a Pause

&gt; The market just put on its best first half performance for the Dow since 1999, the S&amp;P 500 since 1997 and NASDAQ since 2003 – and that’s a pretty decent omen that market will tack on additional gains. Performance below following first-half Dow and S&amp;P 500 gains greater than 7% and NASDAQ Composite gains greater than 10% shows a solid history of gains for the second half – after a tepid market action in Q3.

&gt; Modest gains of about 1% continue into July, but gains little ground during the rest of Q3, which should come as no surprise given the infamous negative history of August and September. On average the market was unable to match first half gains during the second, though the across-the-board 7+% gains over from July to December is still solid. The Dow’s second half win ratio following jumbo gains like 2019 is a rather impressive 85.3% – S&amp;P’s win ration is 80.0%, NAS 73.9%. Full-year gains are virtual lock.

# S&amp;P 500 Sector Weightings: Mid-Year 2019

&gt; Below is an updated snapshot of S&amp;P 500 sector weightings as of mid-year 2019. As shown, the Technology sector makes up the largest slice of the pie with a weighting of 21.48%. Health Care ranks as the second largest sector of the market at 14.20%, followed by Financials at 13.07%. The fact that technology and two service-oriented sectors making up nearly 50% of the index shows how much the US economy has shifted over the years. After the ""big three"" of Tech, Health Care, and Financials, we move down to Consumer Discretionary, Communication Services, and Industrials, which are all right around 10%. Consumer Staples has a weighting of 7.27%, and Energy is all the way down to 5.05% after years of losing share. Utilities, Real Estate, and Materials combine to add up to roughly 9% of the index, so these three sectors are basically immaterial at this point.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Below is a chart showing how much weightings changed in the first half of 2019. The Technology sector gained 1.33 percentage points while Health Care lost 1.23 percentage points, so the gap between the biggest sector (Tech) and the 2nd biggest sector (Health Care) widened by more than 2.5. Consumer Discretionary, Industrials, Real Estate, Materials, and Communication Services all gained share in the first half as well, while Energy, Financials, Consumer Staples, and Utilities all lost share along with Health Care.

# Most Heavily Shorted S&amp;P 500 Stocks

&gt; Below is a list of the 29 stocks in the S&amp;P 500 that have more than 10% of their share float sold short. Luxury retailer Nordstrom (JWN) currently tops the list with 22% of its float sold short. The stock is down 33.86% YTD and 55% from levels seen last November.

&gt; Tax-prep company H&amp;R Block (HRB) is the second most heavily shorted stock with 20.55% of its float sold short. HRB is followed by sports retailer Under Armour (UAA), Snap-On (SNA), and Kohl's (KSS). While JWN and KSS are both down big YTD, HRB, UAA, and SNA are all up nicely on the year.

&gt; There are plenty of other notables on the list, including Macy's (M), Campbell Soup (CPB), TripAdvisor (TRIP), Gap (GPS), Western Union (WU), and Foot Locker (FL), but one common characteristic among many of them is that they are retailers.

&gt; On average, these stocks with 10%+ short interest as a percentage of float are up 8.5% on the year, which is well below the 17% gain that the S&amp;P 500 has seen.

# Yield Curve Craters

&gt; With the 10-year plummeting below 2% again and the 3-month yield spiking up by over 7 basis points (bps), which is its biggest one day gain since December 2017, the yield curve is cratering today. Today's 11 bps move further into inverted territory is the biggest one-day move since January 2nd (see second chart). While not back at new lows, today marks the 29th day that the curve has now been inverted. In Fedspeak news, Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester (who leans hawkish but isn't a voter) just noted in a speech that she's in no hurry to cut. She argues that ""Cutting rates at this juncture could reinforce negative sentiment about a deterioration in the outlook even if this is not the baseline view, and could encourage financial imbalances given the current level of interest rates, which would be counterproductive.""

&gt; What would cause her to change her stance? “If I see a few weak job reports, further declines in manufacturing activity, indicators pointing to weaker business investment and consumption, and declines in readings of longer-term inflation expectations, I would view this as evidence that the base case is shifting to the weak-growth scenario.” A few weak job reports? In other words, she is in no hurry to take any action. Keep in mind, though, that as recently as late February, Mester was still of the view that the FOMC would need to be raising rates later on this year.

# Happy Birthday, And Another Record Goes Down

&gt; “If you’re looking for something to discuss at your barbecue while watching fireworks, be sure to mention this is now the oldest economic cycle in history at 121 months old,” explained LPL Senior Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. That’s right, this cycle just topped the previous record of 120 months from the 1990s technology boom.

&gt; Although 10 years might sound old, keep in mind that developed markets tend to have longer cycles of economic growth. “Is 10 years really that old for an expansion? Maybe not, as Australia hasn’t had a recession for nearly 28 years,” according to Detrick. “Not to mention Canada, the U.K., Spain, and Sweden, which all have had at least 15 years of growth starting in the early 1990s and ending in 2008. Going even further back we see that France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, South Korea, Ireland, and China have all had at least 15-year-plus expansions since World War II.”

&gt; Emerging countries tend to see more of a boom-and-bust type of cycle while more developed nations can have longer-lasting periods of growth. In fact, it’s plausible that the United States could have avoided a recession in 2001 if the 9/11 attacks had not happened, which would have produced a nearly 17-year expansion. So maybe 10 years isn’t so old?

&gt; As our LPL Chart of the Day, This Is Now The Longest Expansion Ever, shows, this is now the longest expansion ever. Additionally, over the decades as the United States turned into a developed nation, the cycles of growth tended to last longer. Thanks to the dual benefits of fiscal and monetary policy, we continue to expect this current cycle to have potentially years of growth left.

# DISCUSS!

What are you all watching for in this upcoming trading week ahead?

*****

I hope you all have a fantastic weekend and a great trading week ahead r/wallstreetbets!"
69,t3_c9xc4p,"This is open for discussion. I was just food shopping and i figured i would try to find the beyond meat products to see how theyre selling, where they are located relative to competitors/related products and what their branding was like. It took me a good minute of scanning the section before i could find the beyond meat products. Nothing made them stand out. And to add, both choices were very full. Maybe 1-2 missing. I asked the guy stocking the shelf how often they rotate/add product and he said since meat products go bad, they only add products once they get low, and that the beyond meat products have been getting thrown out more and more by the week. Plus to add, a pack of 6 beyond meat plant based sausages were selling for $16.99 were a pack of very well known primo sausages were selling 6 for $8.99. Even when i went out of my way to look specifically for the beyond meat product, it was overwhelmingly overtaken by everything else in its section. Nothing made it stand out. If you arent sold on the product BEFORE going into the grocery store, i find the odds someone buying the beyond meat product over another very low. Add the added cost of almost double and you alienate a large group of people who want to try it but refuse to pay that much. 

I would love an open discussion about the product and its future. Competition it might face and obstacles they have to overcome to stand out in this space. 
Try and keep the stock action out of your discussion but no reply will go unread!

Edit: i live on long island. That little thing that sticks off new york. Has one of the highest COL and taxes in the country."

79,t3_c9tg1x,"What are your guys usual trade plan when you purchase ITM calls for let’s say a month exp? If the stock is now 6%+ above your strike and there’s about a week left, would you keep hold to see if it grows or sell and collect profit?"
80,t3_c9w04t,"What kind of analysis do you all do before deciding to buy options? 

So far, I have been following basic support and resistance patterns and I haven't been making money consistently with my actions. It's almost at a 50/50. 

I'd like to know various kinds of analysis that can be done so that I can read and research and apply them.

All helps are appreciated."
81,t3_c9gldq,"This is actually disgusting, the day after July 4th, people sell stocks and make a red day. It’s actually fucking disgusting. This country needs some serious help. The day after we take pride in our country, big banks and other market manipulators decide to sell stocks. I am disgusted to call myself American after today if we close in the red."
82,t3_c9rbi8,"I was wondering how they can be leveraged, pre and post event. Some ideas:

- REITs
- Insurance Companies
- Regional Banks 

As of strategies, short/put before the event and/or buy the dip afterwards? 

Any others ?"
83,t3_c9i6ec,"You can check my post history to see part of the up/down path I took. I blew up, recovered, and blew up again... As it stands I am down $9,500 with $500 left. I just exited a worthless position from July 3 that was alive again this morning to recover from $0 to $500.

As much as it hurts, I hate to say it but you all knew this would happen. To those out there that think they can make it trading FDs, it's literally playing with gasoline and a lighter. You will blow your account up, eventually, without a strong risk management system. Let's face it 99% of the people in this sub have no risk management system whatsoever.

I'm not here to tell you how that system might work just confirming the outcome without one. Of course I'm going to go for that 20bagger with my last $500 and chase that high. But for now I'll take a break for a few weeks.

Don't be like me, unless you want some tax losses for a few years.

Edit: Kids with $1000 in your Robinhood account, don't gamble if you can barely pay rent. The $10k I blew did not affect my quality of life."
85,t3_c9jw3b,"This is just an update on the stock picks I made on Sunday, I will be doing these every Friday. I won't be including $REAL in this update due to the fact that you cant even trade options on this ticker yet.

So 3/5 correct I think that's pretty good given that this is my first week doing DD on this sub. u/SoRefreshing had about a 2/5 to 2.5/5 average of being correct so I guess what I'm trying to say is it literally can't go tits up. And by the way, shout out to all the people who called me retarded for being bullish in Disney because guess what I was right. And an even bigger shout out to the 90% of people on my original post who just commented about the disclaimer instead of about the actual DD.

If you doubt this theory, do your DD, and you will see the writing on the wall. 
I recieved this info from a friend of a friend of a aide in the White House, and researched it myself. 
The shoe-in for AG is a shoe-in, because Trump knows he wont impede Trump's marijuana legalization plan.

106,t3_c99f90,"I'm on the fence about this, which probably means I'm trying to convince myself to do something dumb.  I don't have a ton of free capital, but I do have equity and a great credit score.  I had this idea of getting a personal loan of $25K from the bank and using it (and maybe the margin too) to load up on something in the AMD range of price and volatility.  60 month loan at 7% is $500/month.  Then just write calls as a main source of gains.  I can make a few thousand a month off premiums.  Stock goes up, great.  Stock goes down, buy them back cheap and sell again.  I'm confident enough in AMDs long term outlook of neutral to positive.  I'm not sure if I'd use margin, I know it's generally a bad idea for long term holds.  Anyone know which broker has the best margin interest rates by the way?

What's the worst thing about this plan?

107,t3_c9glm5,"Facebook Watch apparently has garnered an audience of 750 million monthly active users, up 47% from 400 million in December 2018. This is huge and makes Facebook Watch alone one of the largest social platforms in the world, growing at an incredibly fast rate as well. Apparently content creators are being compensated well, this implies that Facebook has been able to successfully monetize this platform, nothing new since this is basically what YouTube does and has been doing.

Now for the DD:

Nobody is fucking talking about this!

Everyone and their mother wants to dog on Facebook right now for their new Libra initiative in the wake of their huge privacy scandal. People are IGNORING this gold mine. Join me brothers.

132,t3_c8wk2x,"Estimates for Q2 EPS growth as of June 28th were -0.21%. Since firms usually beat estimates, it’s likely we will see growth. Even in the last recession more than half of companies beat estimates. We’re not suggesting earnings seasons in the last recession were good. They were bad because estimates cratered ahead of time.

So far in Q2, 20 S&amp;P 500 firms have reported earnings. They are listed below.

[First 20 firms](

While these 20 firms are not necessarily indicative of the results we will see from the rest of the companies, given the small sample size, they give us an early idea of whether there is a risk of earnings season being terrible. The point here is these first 20 firms don’t support the narrative that earnings season is going to be terrible. 17 of these firms beat EPS estimates.

As we mentioned, earnings estimates are what is important. They generally fall. It’s about how much they are falling (rate of change). The table shows the changes to each firm’s Q3 earnings estimate. This is better than looking at if the company beat or missed estimates. For example, Micron beat EPS estimates, but it’s Q3 estimates fell 22.03%, meaning these results weren’t good. The average estimate cut is 1.57% for those firms. We will be watching the change in Q3 EPS estimates to measure this earnings season instead of looking at absolute growth.

""fun tesla numbers

*for Q4 2018*

based on revrec standards and napkin math, 90,700 vehicles delivered (required to recognize revenue) brought in 7.23Bn for an average of $79,713/car

we know in q1 2019 they delivered a lot fewer cars

""Deliveries were approximately 63,000 vehicles, which was 110% more than the same quarter last year, but 31% less than last quarter. This included approximately 50,900 Model 3 and 12,100 Model S and X.""

that's going to represent 5.0Bn in revenue for the quarter, assuming the sales mix stayed exactly the same (which we know it didn't since the models S and X delivered were reduced by almost half)

i don't know what their Q1 revenue guidance was, but they are almost definitely going to miss and by a lot

Edit: I'm probably going to do some new math tonight as I'm aware tesla gets revenue from non-vehicle sales.""

turns out i was estimating high and non-vehicle revenue was significantly lower than expected (down almost 20% YoY), resulting in net revenue of 4.5Bn

based on the same napkin math (unchanged margin) and adjusted to say that revenue from non-vehicle sales remained constant;

revenue should be in the 6.34Bn range for automotive and 300MM for non-auto for a total around 6.64Bn, given the speed of the shanghai build and the panasonic issues it wouldn't surprise me to see capital expenditures way up (again). there's also less ZEV available to them and i believe they've lowered the price of their cars to account for the loss of tax credits, that represents another potential haircut to revenue and margins

TSLA doesn't do revenue guidance, just deliveries. earningswhisper has estimated revenue at 6.78Bn which i think is definitely going to miss, and EPS of (1.78) which is always a crapshoot since TSLA uses the shadiest accounting practices available, but hard to imagine it won't continue to be below expectations.

July 2, 2019, 9:01 PM PDT

When Alshair Fiyaz, a wealthy businessman with a shaggy mane of hair, walked into the garden of London’s Four Seasons Hotel on a pleasant June evening five years ago, he had no idea he was being followed. He was there to meet Walid Choucair, a trader wearing a hoodie who collected “Star Wars” memorabilia and expensive guitars. Neither one noticed an officer from the National Crime Agency stick a recording device in the greenery.

&amp;#x200B;

The investigator was tracking Fiyaz in connection with an insider-trading probe being conducted by the NCA, the U.K. equivalent of the FBI. Choucair wasn’t a suspect, and the officer didn’t know who he was before planting the bug. But after the meeting, the officer followed Choucair to an apartment near the Royal Albert Hall on the edge of Hyde Park.

&amp;#x200B;

That fateful encounter at the Four Seasons, recounted in court, would turn Choucair, whose life was an adrenaline-charged chase for information about big deals, into Europe’s most high-profile insider-trading defendant. And his two trials—the first ended last year in a hung jury, the second with a conviction last week—opened a window on a loose network of traders from London to Dubai as well as a multinational investigation into suspected insider trading.

&amp;#x200B;

Fiyaz’s name, and details of the Four Seasons meeting, came up frequently at the trials. Choucair said he often discussed trades with Fiyaz, who was so successful he’d bought an 86-meter yacht and a polo club. The two had partied at Tramp, a London club frequented by rock stars and royals, where they spent thousands of dollars on three-liter bottles of Cristal. Financial institutions alerted U.K. regulators about Fiyaz’s trading 71 times in 2013 and 2014, Choucair’s lawyer told the court, citing information from the regulator. Yet Fiyaz wasn’t in the dock. He’s never been charged with a crime and denies any wrongdoing.

&amp;#x200B;

But evidence, testimony and legal filings from Choucair’s trials, as well as interviews with traders, their friends, lawyers and people close to the investigation suggest Fiyaz may have been part of a network that cultivated ties to bankers, shared tips via burner phones to avoid detection, fed information to journalists and often secretly monitored each other’s trades. Using their own money or funds from wealthy associates, they made tens of millions of dollars betting on stocks just before a news splash popped the share price. In 2014, the core group of about a dozen traders made more than $100 million, a figure arrived at by adding up figures in legal filings and conversations with traders.

&amp;#x200B;

Regulators in France and the U.K., where abnormal trading occurs ahead of more than one in five takeovers, spotted the uncanny timing of transactions by Fiyaz, Choucair and others. In addition to Choucair and Fabiana Abdel-Malek, a UBS Group AG compliance officer convicted at the same trial of providing him with information from a confidential bank database, seven men, including Geneva-based trader Alexis Kuperfis and former Societe Generale SA banker Stephane Fima, have been charged with insider trading in France. All have contested the charges. Another trader was arrested in Serbia in November on a U.S. warrant that alleged he committed securities fraud and was extradited in May, Serbian court officials confirmed. U.S. prosecutors are working with European counterparts on their own probe, Bloomberg News reported last month.

&amp;#x200B;

A spokeswoman for Fiyaz said in an email that he has “never been questioned, charged or convicted of insider trading or financial misconduct of any kind in the U.K. or any jurisdiction.” She said the suspicious activity reports related to only 27 trades and were triggered because financial institutions are required to flag transactions when a trader makes more than 10,000 pounds ($13,000) a day, and that Fiyaz hasn’t been the subject of any adverse regulatory findings. Loic Henriot, a lawyer for Kuperfis, said his client has never been part of a network of traders exchanging information. David-Olivier Kaminski, an attorney for Fima, said his client has nothing to do with the investigations that led to Choucair’s conviction.

&amp;#x200B;

Choucair, now 40, testified at his trial about his first conversation with Fiyaz, six years his senior, at a pricey Chinese restaurant in London around 2005. They had seen each other at Tramp, where Choucair, the son of a Lebanese construction executive, was a member. Fiyaz and his brother Javed started showing up that year, according to two people familiar with the club scene. They would arrive in separate Rolls-Royces, descend the stairs, pass the red-neon Let’s Get Tramped sign and set up camp in a corner, surrounded by a clutch of women. Choucair would spend thousands of dollars in that den two or three times a month. Whenever he ordered a $4,000 bottle of Champagne, the staff would play the “Star Wars” theme music and announce “Lebanon is in the house,” according to people who’d been there with him.

&amp;#x200B;

Choucair was out with a friend who knew Fiyaz when they spotted each other at the Chinese restaurant. They got to talking. “We spent the whole night having drinks, which I was very good at, and having a conversation, which he was very good at,” Choucair would testify at his trial 14 years later, trying to explain that his stock tips were coming from traders like Fiyaz and Kuperfis and not from his friend at UBS.

&amp;#x200B;

Choucair had a privileged upbringing in London. He boarded at Mill Hill, a 212-year-old school set on 150 acres of lush parkland. But it was something more avant-garde that first got his heart racing as a young boy. Watching TV one day, he saw Guns N’ Roses’ wild-haired guitarist Slash tear through a solo and decided he, too, wanted to be a guitar hero. When he was 18, his father died and he inherited a fortune. He spent the next years in a blur of benders, and, in his sober moments, completed a business degree at King’s College London, he said at his trial. He bought an Aston Martin, started collecting guitars and filled his apartment with life-size figures from his other boyhood obsession, “Star Wars.”

&amp;#x200B;

Fiyaz was raised with his brother in Belgium, where their father, a Pakistani businessman, had settled. They got started at the family company and made their money from shipping and investments ranging from Nigerian oil blocks to Danish department stores and a chocolatier, according to people who’ve met them and information on their websites. But they also attracted the attention of Belgian police, who suspected them of carrying out a scheme to avoid paying value-added taxes, two people familiar with the matter say. The investigation was closed after Fiyaz and his brother agreed to a settlement including a seven-figure payment, one of the people said. Neither was charged, and there was no admission of wrongdoing. Fiyaz’s spokeswoman said the dispute was over whether sales by his company were exempt.

&amp;#x200B;

By the mid-2000s, the brothers had moved to London, where they caused a stir in the Mayfair social scene. Alshair, the younger and more athletic of the two, was permanently dressed to go out. He and Javed faced each other across a pair of imposing desks in an office behind the Dorchester Hotel, where they ran their shipping business. They told people they were looking for fresh investment opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

When Choucair saw Fiyaz’s trading setup, he testified, he was intrigued and wanted in. He said that Fiyaz and Kuperfis, nicknamed the Cowboy because he hit the mark so often, showed him how to competitively trade contracts for difference, or CFDs, derivatives that allow a person to bet on a company’s stock without owning shares. It’s a way of trading on margin. With a relatively small down payment, profits and losses can exceed those when buying shares. Many countries have restricted their sale because retail investors can underestimate the risks and incur outsize losses.

&amp;#x200B;

Choucair and his associates were a paradoxical bunch. They relied on each other for tip-offs but were suspicious that others were spying on them. Fiyaz accused his brokers of telling people about his positions in the market, according to four of the traders. Some accused him of scoping out their trading positions. Discretion was paramount, and that included using untraceable communications, Choucair testified. Choucair soon had four handsets with unregistered SIM cards for the traders he was talking to. Fiyaz insisted he keep a line dedicated to him, Choucair said in court. Every few months, the traders replaced their SIM cards, and, often, their devices. Fiyaz’s spokeswoman declined to comment on the specifics of Choucair’s testimony but said the jury that convicted him had found it to be untruthful.

&amp;#x200B;

In 2011, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission froze assets belonging to Fiyaz and another trader, saying they were suspected of making millions of dollars with the help of inside information on trades related to Lonza Group AG’s $1.2 billion acquisition of Arch Chemicals Inc., which Fiyaz benefited from. Authorities dropped the case the next year because of a lack of evidence, and Fiyaz wasn’t accused of insider trading. Investigators lamented that the other trader had harmed the probe by discarding a BlackBerry that SEC lawyers believed contained text messages about his activity, according to U.S. court filings.

&amp;#x200B;

In Choucair’s case, the Financial Conduct Authority, which led the probe, was convinced it had found his insider. Choucair met Abdel-Malek through their mothers. Choucair’s had asked Abdel-Malek’s to make curtains for the tall windows in her son's apartment. They hit it off and introduced the two children to each other. Abdel-Malek, the oldest of three daughters of religious Coptic Christians from Egypt, was kept on a tight leash, even when she got a position at UBS in London in 2007. By early 2013, Abdel-Malek was a relatively experienced compliance officer at a newly restructured division of the bank. She could look at any deal in which UBS was involved.

&amp;#x200B;

She had little contact with Choucair for years. But that spring they reconnected, and he invited her and a friend to Tramp to celebrate his birthday, she testified in court. He spent 10,000 pounds that night on Champagne, vodka and club sandwiches, it came out in court, and the party lasted until 3 a.m. Their friendship developed, though both said the relationship wasn’t romantic. Later that spring, he bought her a BlackBerry identical to her work model with a disposable SIM card.

&amp;#x200B;

Prosecutors had company database records showing Abdel-Malek was trawling for deals. She testified that she did this to improve her deals literacy, something her managers had asked her to do. Over the next year, prosecutors said, there were about 30 transactions she kept coming back to, telling Choucair when something was imminent, though the pair were only charged in connection with five of them. When prosecutors presented a motive to the jury, they said the glamour of going to Tramp was enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Meanwhile, the wider group of traders kept nailing stock picks before news of pending mergers broke. Fiyaz and Kuperfis made about 55 million euros ($62 million) combined trading ahead of the announcement of General Electric Co.’s 2014 deal to acquire most of Alstom SA, court records and people familiar with the matter said. Fiyaz’s spokeswoman said she was unwilling to comment on his trading earnings but denied any impropriety.

&amp;#x200B;

Over time, Fiyaz acquired a mansion on the outskirts of Paris, the Polo Club of St. Tropez and a yacht named Ecstasea with two helicopter landing pads that once belonged to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. While it’s unknown how much Fiyaz paid for the yacht, the previous owner bought it for 100 million euros in 2009, according to a U.K. court document. In 2016, Fiyaz hosted a party aboard Ecstasea for the benefit of the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, his spokeswoman said. She declined on privacy grounds to say how much he paid for the yacht.

&amp;#x200B;

But the suspected trading network was heading for trouble. Even before the GE-Alstom deal, a friend of another member of the group, a deals lawyer, was getting divorced. It got nasty, and the lawyer’s former brother-in-law wrote a letter to French investigators saying he’d overheard him exchanging tips with a trader, according to people familiar with the information.

&amp;#x200B;

Investigators had already dedicated resources to cracking down on insider trading, spurred in part by the French government’s anger that information about the GE-Alstom deal was leaked to the press. The regulators built up phone records connecting the group, the people familiar with the matter said. They secured wiretaps, including for the burner phone of a hair salon owner at one of Paris’s most exclusive hotels, whom they suspected of being a go-between, according to French investigative documents. The trail led to French ski resorts, the Cayman Islands, Geneva and eventually to the garden of London’s Four Seasons Hotel.

&amp;#x200B;

A transcript of the recording made at the Four Seasons and shown to the jury at Choucair’s trial revealed he was talking to someone on the phone about a deal for a U.S. energy company. Choucair testified that the person was Jeffrey McCracken, at the time head of deals coverage at Bloomberg News.

&amp;#x200B;

Choucair said he often spoke to reporters, sometimes at the behest of other traders, in the hope they would confirm his tips and publish an article that would cause the share price to spike. That day, Choucair testified in the second trial, Fiyaz had come to London to discuss the energy deal. McCracken, who left Bloomberg in 2017 to join CNBC and hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing, declined to comment.

&amp;#x200B;

Bloomberg reporters regularly receive tips from people active in the market and were first to report on several deals mentioned in this article. The news organization’s policy is not to publish any information without confirming with people who have direct knowledge of the matter. The policy also prohibits telling sources when a story will be published.

&amp;#x200B;

Choucair seemed to know about the investigation before his arrest. In November 2014, he called Kuperfis to warn him. There’s a “big f--king investigation,” he blurted out in a conversation recorded by French investigators and played at Choucair’s trial. Within weeks, Kuperfis and two others were raided in France and Geneva. Kuperfis has been charged with insider trading in France in connection with his trading ahead of chemical producer Air Liquide SA’s $10 billion takeover of Airgas Inc., but he has challenged the legality of the wiretaps, and the case hasn’t come to trial. His lawyer said he couldn’t comment on the case other than to say the charges are unfounded.

&amp;#x200B;

Choucair’s lawyers said in court that his client knew about the probe because he was told by Fiyaz, who, the lawyer recounted, had claimed he had gotten the information from a National Crime Agency interpreter, according to the judge's summary of the allegations, which weren’t shared with the jury. Before his arrest, Choucair had written a letter that he hid under a rug in his apartment and that was discovered by investigators, according to the judge’s summary. In it, the summary said, he described what Fiyaz had told him about his NCA sources. The NCA said in December that it’s investigating the matter. Fiyaz’s spokeswoman said he has never had any relationship with investigators at the NCA or other regulatory agencies.

&amp;#x200B;

Choucair had his apartment swept for bugs, one person familiar with the matter said, though none were found. He called the FCA, his lawyer said in court. Then, at 6:30 a.m. one morning in September 2015, there was a knock on the door. About a dozen NCA officers had come to arrest him for insider trading. “I knew you were coming,” Choucair said, according to an account his lawyer gave in court.

&amp;#x200B;

Across the street, they searched his mother’s house. A few miles away, Abdel-Malek’s sister woke her in her bedroom on the top floor of their family home. Two NCA officers were there to arrest her. They found a printout of price-sensitive information in a Chanel handbag and, according to people with knowledge of the matter, a new 30,000-pound Rolex, worth more than a quarter of her annual salary, along with a receipt. The jury wasn’t told about the watch.

&amp;#x200B;

A few months after his release, Choucair was called back to the police station. Two FCA investigators sat opposite him in a small featureless room. They kept asking him about Fiyaz, Kuperfis and others, Choucair’s lawyer said in court. Choucair kept quiet.

&amp;#x200B;

During the first trial last fall, Abdel-Malek’s white-haired father sat in the gallery with clenched teeth, clutching a wooden cross and family photographs. Prosecutors couldn’t point to any payments she received, and Choucair was convincing on the witness stand. His lawyer told the jury that Fiyaz and other traders were just as likely a source of information for Choucair as Abdel-Malek. After all, they had bet far more heavily on the very same trades, and Choucair had been in frequent contact with them beforehand.

&amp;#x200B;

In December, a few days before the end of the first trial, Choucair returned to Tramp. He was playing guitar with his band White Collar. The room was dark, and Choucair, wearing a hoodie and Converse sneakers, lingered in the background, barely moving to the music. The other four band members, wearing leather, tattoos and eye-liner, filled the tiny stage. Then Choucair stepped forward to sing Bon Jovi’s It’s My Life. By the time the group was on to Guns N’ Roses’ Sweet Child O’ Mine, the electric bass player was pulling his shirt off and climbing onto the drum kit below a chandelier. One band member grabbed the microphone and egged the crowd on. “This might be our last gig,” he said, without explaining that the man who was bankrolling the group might go to jail.

&amp;#x200B;

It wasn’t Choucair’s last gig. The jury was unable to come to a verdict. At the second trial this year, Fiyaz involved himself more in the proceedings. At times, he had as many as five lawyers in the courtroom. One was a defense counsel who told the judge that Choucair had falsely accused Fiyaz of wrongdoing. “These are very serious allegations which are made against my client,” the lawyer said. “These are allegations which he denies. He’s never been arrested or charged in relation to any of these matters. The FCA has never cautioned him or even invited him in in relation to any of these matters. He is a man of previous good character.”

&amp;#x200B;

Then, just before Choucair was cross-examined, the FCA told the jury it had received information that Fiyaz, via an intermediary, had an insider at Citigroup Inc. The agency said it didn’t have time to investigate if any confidential information had been passed to Fiyaz. Last week, the Wall Street Journal reported additional details about the alleged intermediary. A Citigroup spokeswoman declined to comment. Fiyaz “vehemently denies” that he traded on inside information obtained from Citigroup or any other financial institution, his spokeswoman said.

&amp;#x200B;

This time the Fiyaz-was-my-tipster defense didn’t work. Choucair and Abdel-Malek were both convicted on all five counts and sentenced to three years in prison. Both plan to appeal.

&amp;#x200B;

Fiyaz wasn’t in court during the eight-week trial, or for the verdict. Traders and lawyers weren’t sure where he was. One said Argentina. Another said he’d been seen at an Alpine ski chalet. In May, Fiyaz’s name appeared on the roster of a polo team contesting the Sun Trophy at his club in France, which once paraded scantily clad models and white Bentleys in front of guests. (Fiyaz’s spokeswoman said he wasn’t involved in the day-to-day operations of the club and doesn’t condone the objectification of women.)

&amp;#x200B;

But on an uncharacteristically rainy Sunday, there was no sign of Fiyaz on or off the polo pitch tucked away in a forest about 20 minutes west of St. Tropez by car. In the members’ section, a dozen spectators sitting in wicker armchairs, sheltered by awnings, braved the bad weather to watch Fiyaz’s team take a 5-2 drubbing. When asked after the match why Fiyaz had been replaced by another player, a worker at the club said he had been ordered not to talk. The reason, his spokeswoman said a few weeks later, was that it happened to fall during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and Fiyaz was fasting.

137,t3_c8tgkx,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

138,t3_c8y7yy,"I've read that the chances of a 25bp rate cut at the July 31st meeting is 100%.  With nothing really going bad in terms of economic numbers and also a trade war that seems to be on hold, I think it is far-fetched to think Powell is going to cut rates.  Euro/USD cross rate is in a holding pattern.  Gold seems to have hit a little pause too.  Anyone see anything happening between now and July 31st that would encourage the Fed to the rate cut?  Bad UE numbers?  Another trade problem?"
141,t3_c8pnaz,"Guns are a big industry in the US, and are closely tied to politics and policy. The best thing for the gun industry was Obama. All of the gun groups ran fear mongering that he would ban certain guns, destroy/reduce ammo, take our guns, etc. Ammo was selling so fast you couldn't get your hands on it, gun sales were through the roof with the 'get em while you can' mentality, gun manufacturers couldn't make the stuff fast enough.

Prior to the 2016 election, manufacturers increased production and stockpiled, expecting Hillary and another huge boom in sales. When Trump got elected, demand plummeted and supply was through the roof. Remington declared bankruptcy and Smith and Wesson renamed to AOBC. VSTO (ammo) and AOBC (guns and accessories) fell to nickels on the dollar off their previous price, and the cost of gun stuff plummeted (now is the best time there has been to buy US made guns/ammo).

The Democrats have tied gun regulation very closely to their campaign this time. The campaigns are just now starting, and these two stocks AOBC and VSTO are just starting to crawl out of the mud after the DNC debate. My bet is to long these and sell right before the election. The uncertainty leading up to it should increase sales. The real gamble would be to hold these and reap more profits if a Democrat gets elected."

Not a house flipping initiative, providing a service allowing sellers to get their house sold quicker for a fee and then marketing those houses back out to a massive audience. Win/Win for seller, allows them to get paid quicker and not have to worry about updates/selling process/typical real estate commissions.
 
Zillow website/app is the 18th most visited website in the United States, most of those coming from mobile (easily accessible).
18th sounds good? that beats Netflix #19, Pinterest #23, Linkedin #25.
 
-Zillow is able to constantly advertise their houses first and send emails to users/notifications, as well as the constant traffic they receive.
 
-Zillow has mass amounts of data that will help them improve their system as time goes on. This will make their estimates better and can help them market houses out more efficiently. Think Netflix and how they leverage data to pick the perfect show for you!
195 Million monthly visitors
 
Traditional Real Estate market is a massive opportunity and Zillow does not need the whole pie...only a piece of it.
 
Younger generations will browse apps for homes, Zillow being the largest allows them to be ahead of the game.
 
Zillow offers currently:
Phoenix, Arizona
Las Vegas, Nevada
Atlanta, Georgia
Denver, Colorado
Charlotte, North Carolina
Raleigh, North Carolina
Houston, Texas
Riverside, California
Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas
Minneapolis, Minnesota
 
Zillow offers by q1 2020
Orlando, Florida
Portland, Oregon
Nashville, Tennessee
Miami, Florida
San Diego, California
San Antonio, Texas
Austin, Texas
Sacramento, California
Tampa, Florida
Los Angeles, California
 
 
Accelerated revenue opportunity. Not to mention that they still make a good portion of revenue from their underlying advertisement business. Sellers can use Zillow offers to get a ballpark value for their house, even if they do not sell with Zillow...Zillow can update data and fine tune.
 
Obviously capital intensive and has its fair share of risk…but upside in my opinion is significant. Big data is important and they have mass amounts of data coming in. Look at the reports they are able to release on housing data…more detailed then what the government can even put together. The key point I like to push, is this does not need to kill of traditional real estate…I do not think it will…but it can definitely take a piece of the pie and more as time goes on.
I know there is other companies that do this, but none have the traffic/user data that Zillow will be able to leverage as time goes on.
 
It has had a nice run recently, so it may not be the ideal time to hop in..but that being said as of 6/14 it had 26million shares short, with only 2.8 million daily volume. There is definitely room for a large short squeeze if we see the positive momentum continue.
I was lucky enough to get in around 35, but I am holding strong.

147,t3_c8tgwc,"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

154,t3_c8tmnj,"So, as we continue to see bond yields meltdown, it’s really peaked my curiosity. Lower yields and inverting curves suggest deteriorating economic conditions, and yet, the market pushes higher.

In doing research, yields going downward makes stocks go up as the price of the bond goes higher. The higher the yield, this has the inverse effect of pushing stock prices downward. 

Knowing these things, why wouldn’t the market sputter along until July 31 when FOMC is expected to produce rate cuts? Are traders, by forecasting rate cuts, just getting profits earlier than late July right now, or does this market continue to run higher between now and late July?

Also, let’s say FOMC cuts by 50 basis points. We can all agree there will be another pop after the announcement. But what happens the next day? We know companies are signaling weaker guidance for the rest of the year. Does the market price in another rate cut and we do this all over again? And if so, when would a correction even happen as this seems like a sell sustaining situation?

&amp;#x200B;

As of now, the borrow rates I am seeing for BYND are about 106%, this was down from 116% yesterday and from 110% the day before. Fidelity, Schwab and a few others max out at 99% before charging higher rates to their institutional clients vs. their retail client base. That is data I don't have access to.

&amp;#x200B;

Last update we have from S3 (data analytics firm) is from July 1st and is that BYND has 5.44m shares shorted, about 46.4% of the float. Borrow rate they were seeing was 113% and rising. But that is a couple day old data.

&amp;#x200B;

So where do we go from here? I am still holding my August calls, but I have a bit of cushion in the positions to wait and see. Obviously the past few days have been rough. Price and volume down- not good combinations. If I capitulate and sell, you'll know its the bottom :) Let me know if I am being an idiot.

&amp;#x200B;

186,t3_c8dc4u,"I love to golf, but I've never owned golf stocks because they're not exciting. Until now. Take Callaway (ELY) for example. Jana (a highly-successful activist hedge fund) recently disclosed a 9.5% stake in Callaway, saying that its undervalued and they plan to discuss strategic initiatives. I'm not surprised by this position for a number of reasons:

\- Golf participation and interest has increased YoY since the first time in 2003 according to a recent study. Further, the National Golf Federation estimated that 2.6 million beginners played for the first time last year, which is a historic high. I am an avid golfer and I can see it happening.

\- Callaway also owns a 14% stake in Top Golf, which is growing rapidly. Top Golf is super-fun and is transforming the sport a bit to make it accessible for people who are otherwise disinterested in traditional golf. Not to mention that its valued as high as $6B (ELY has a market cap of $1.62B).

\- From a technical perspective, ELY is 29% off its 52 week high, and looking back to their August earnings report last year, they experienced a 15% pop immediately after and a further 10% run up after an earnings blowout.

ELY looks like its settling out after some recent profit-taking from the Jana announcement and I think its poised for a nice run up to earnings. What do you guys think? What am I missing?"
187,t3_c8hah7,"Here's my bull and bear case for Q2, spreadsheet here:



Methodology:

I started with Q1 automotive revenue and backed out the $215 million of regulatory credits that Elon failed to disclose during the earnings call, and we didn't see until the [10-Q]( 

From there I took total automotive revenue, and backed into the ASPs, modeled from historical ASPs and price differentials between the models.  I then took total automotive COGS, and backed into gross margins again using historical data for the gross margins and spread between the models.  I spent a lot of time tinkering with the ASPs and GMs and feel pretty confident in these; as those are the most import assumption in the predictions.  Changing any one with any significance in one direction throws off revenues or cogs too significantly, or deviates too much from historical trends.


**Bull Case**

I then move this data forward to the bull case, and updated with today's new delivery totals.  [Mid quarter]( Tesla dropped prices for Model S &amp; X, by $2k and $3k. I decreased the ASP for S &amp; X buy $1k and $2k respectively.  Since this would all hit gross profit, I reduced gross margins by 1% for each S &amp; X, and a minor reduction for Model 3 due to more SR+.  

Since Elon packed Q1 with $200 million of GHG credits to pad the numbers, I assume no GHG for Q2, and $100 million in ZEV, which would be on the high end.  I held all remaining revenue and expense constant, including Energy, Service, R&amp;D and SG&amp;A and arrived at a **Net Loss of $545 million**

**Bear Case**

For the bear case, I took another $1k off of Model S &amp; X, as there was strong evidence of significant discounting in Europe to clear old inventory, and $3k off of Model 3 ASPs due to an significant amount of SR+ deliveries in Canada.  Since discounting is a direct hit to margins, I reduced gross margins each by 1%.  

I added a more realistic $50 million in ZEV credits, held Energy flat, increased Service by $58 million due to numerous issues popping up all over as the fleet increases.  R&amp;D, SG&amp;A and remaining line items all flat.  I conclude with a bear case, of **$730 million loss**.  

Now there are a massive amount of one off items that could hit Tesla to the downside, including writing down inventory, increasing warranty reserves or any further restructuring.  For this reason, I believe actual results will be closer to my bear case, than my bull case.

I appreciate any criticism, especially at my Q1 ASPs and Gross Margins."

191,t3_c8bn30,"So last week I decided to take a glance on who is releasing earnings this week, and who do I think is a safe bet to have a decent pop of about 5% or more.   After glancing over and doing some research, I decided to do Accuity Brands (AYI).

&amp;#x200B;

I then bought 75 shares @ 134.41on Thursday.   On Friday it went up a bit and I was feeling good about it, so I decided to buy some more; so I bought 50 shares @ 140.04.

&amp;#x200B;

This morning they released earnings and the stock reacted badly as it went down 10% pre-market.   I instantly was down over $1,700 on the day... so what did I do?

&amp;#x200B;

Although they missed their revenue, they still beat their EPS estimates and I decided to go in some more on the dip; so I bought 75 shares @ 122.22.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I have 200 shares at a total cost of $26,249 and the stock has jumped up to 132.50 where it now puts me at a profit of about $250.

193,t3_c8b89l,"Hello my little Auties.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to explain a trade that you've all probably heard of since it's a giant finance meme.  The thing is, it's a great trade that actually works under the right circumstances.  I believe that right now the circumstances are right.

&amp;#x200B;

**sHoRt ThE vIx**.  Yes that's the trade.  In general I think we can all agree that the market has a bias to go up, and on the way up the market is slow and orderly... bulls take the stairs, bears take the window is the idea.  Anyways, when the market isn't losing it's shit, the VIX will remain chill.  

&amp;#x200B;

The thing about shorting the VIX is that depending on how you do it, you make money as long as the market doesn't sell-off, regardless of whether or not the VIX actually goes down.  See options below.  **The last one is the best one in my opinion**.

&amp;#x200B;

These are your options to short.

&amp;#x200B;

1.  **Options on VIX directly**.  Don't do this, it's for either hedge fund geniuses or autistic idiots - I'm going to guess you're the latter.
2. **Options or spreads on volatility ETFs**.  Don't  ever be long these options.  They're priced to reflect the fact these products go down.  Maybe bear credit spreads, but I personally like the next option better.
3. **Short shares of vol-ETFs**.  This is the winner, I'll explain why.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll explain how trade 3 works.  Your options are VXX, UVXY, TVIX.  Margin requirements from brokers I use are insane for UVXY and TVIX and borrowing costs are higher.  I just directly short VXX.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok so how do these things work?  Basically they buy month 2 volatility futures and sell month 1.  Well, the volatility curve is GENERALLY always in contango (like 90%+ of the time), which means is slopes up and to the right, which means the near term months are cheaper than the outer months.  So if the market isn't wigging out, VXX will constantly buy M2 and sell M1.  Which means it constantly loses money, again, as long as the market isn't freaking out.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even care all that much about macro news, I like to look at price action.  If the market is back in drift up mode there is a lot of premium left to be pulled out of vols.  Just check  [  \- M1-M2 contango is almost 9% right now.  That means VXX is going down unless the market sells off.  Even if the market is down (like today), VXX is still going to go down in general.

&amp;#x200B;

Watch your positions and cover your short if M1 ever goes above M2, or take profit when you want.  Don't get greedy, this one can blow up.  The longer you're in the trade though, the better it is - if you can build up a 40% gain over time (2017 lolz), spikes do less to you, borrowing costs are lower, and margin use is smaller and smaller because it's all based on the short market value of your position.

&amp;#x200B;

**TLDR:  stop losing money and make the ultimate theta trade - short VXX.  Check**  [**  **and if the line goes up and to the right, sell some VXX short.  Cover if the first dot on the line goes above the second, or whenever you want to take profit.**"

Sanford Bernstein provides an in-depth primer on the various forms of EV credits and dimensions their potential impact to TSLA going forward.

1. TSLA has received payments of between $160M and $420M for sold EV regulatory credits in each of the last 5 years, and the company revealed that automotive gross margins in Q1 were boosted by 400bps from these credits.

2. The majority of TSLA’s regulatory credit income has come from the sale of ZEV credits in California, but going forward the bigger category for TSLA will likely be European pooling payments.

3. There is a significant CO2 emissions standard hitting Europe in 2020, and Toni estimates that FCA will pay TSLA ~$900M to $1B over the next 3 years to mitigate European fines, along with another $600M in non-ZEV credits in the US. This ~$600M-$1.1B profit stream could prove to be a valuable bridge for TSLA between the Model 3 program and the Model Y, and Toni implores the company to provide more transparency on their realized expected regulatory credit income

4. Bernstein remains ""Market Perform and target price $325"

So what would you understand?

Weather. When it's cold, shit freezes. When shit freezes, crops get fucked. In brazil right now there is chance shit is going to Freeze this upcoming week/weekend which will put coffee on the moon.

[ClimaTempo]( uses a combination of both the US and European weather modelling techniques and is more reliable then other sources i have used.  Right now  The temperatures for  Minas Gerais (Alfenas, Cabo Verde, Tres pontas, Guaxupe)  are in the 2/3 degree  range,(Celsius you dumb fucks) for July 6th and July 7th...slightly up from predictions this weekend.

**TL/DL Buy coffee futures. If you can't, Buy JO**. If you only want to bet on cold, buy  near by expiring options on JO even though they are hilariously low volume. Do this because 1) it might be cold in Brazil and 2) Coffee is 'due' for a bounce back.

EDIT: Jesus Christ, a lot of you actually throwing a couple hundred bucks on double zero. I love you guys.

EDIT2: Take your dam gains now.  This weekend the cold front makes landfall and the weather reports will get more accurate. Obviously this could go either way but no one ever lost money taking gains.  
Or better yet. After you take your gains, talk halff them gains and buy a true  JO lotto ticket (July 19 42  C mayhaps?).

241,t3_c80wca,"Disclaimer: this DD is not very autistic in the sense that it’s not much of an FD/gamble. But I’m seeing a lot of people that want to make smart plays and/or join theta gang, and I think we have here a fantastic opportunity to make an easy 10% in three weeks. So if you’re looking for that, here we go with a good starting point. Again, not autistic, but a good play. 

IF you believe the following three premises, then I think you can easily make 10% in just three weeks. 

1. Trump and Xi will not come to a trade agreement this month. 

2. Earnings will generally be muted at best, and most likely straight up disappointing. 

3. The Fed will not cut interest rates this month unless the economy tanks. 

The play: Sell solidly OTM call spreads on SPY. My personal favorite: 7/26 $302/$305 spreads.  I sold a bunch before close for $53/spread. The plan is to close for $23/spread for 10% gains ($30 on each $300 of collateral). 

Discussion:

1. Trump and Xi will not come to an agreement this month. We have yet to see anything from China that indicates they are willing to give ground on the fundamental issues. Meanwhile Trump keeps emphasizing that any deal must favor the US. China has made moves to become less reliant on the US in anticipation of extended tariffs. This recent truce involved no actual progress on key disagreements. Perhaps a deal is made eventually, but not soon. 

2. Earnings start ramping up this month. Most companies are toning down guidance and reporting that performance will decline year over year due to the effects of tariffs and slowed production. With no end in sight of the substantial tariffs, guidance will be low and expectations will be tempered. We aren’t going to see the types of earnings beats that cause stocks to push past ATHs. In addition, more and more articles will come out highlighting these facts over the next few weeks. 

3.  The Fed will not cut rates this month. The economy is still healthy. It’s not booming in the same way that it has been, but the primary goals of the fed are under control. Despite more dovish language at their last meeting, the Fed is still in a “wait and see” attitude about rate cuts and does not want to pull the trigger prematurely. If really bad economic data comes out, they could lower rates. But their dot plot actually shows very minor rate cuts before more rate hikes in the coming years. It would take a harsh economic downturn to force their hand (which would likely be fine for this play as well). If the economy tanks, selling calls is a good play. 

Therefore, I see no catalysts that can push us higher than the $297 area we could not push through on this weekend’s news. The market might not go down, because Trump is a master at propping it up, but there is no real reason to push through and blast through ATH without one of the three fundamental issues above changing. 

So enter the spreads and relax for a month of slow burn gains- if you want to join theta gang or bear gang, this is your invitation."

256,t3_c82vme,"Tldr: long YY cuz people like to see titties that's not porn as warm up.

I owned this pos for couple of years. Decent opportunity at this price. Basically the twitch of China plus entertainment (singing dancing) content.

Wtf is YY and what happened to the stock over past two years?

Unlike western companies YY monetizes long form live stream content with gifting in lieu of ads. Imagine of twitch thots can easily solicit donations, yes, YY built entire modes to entice followers to gift the streamer, like whoever receives the most gifts win.

Obviously that's a pretty good business. Huge growth while the company keeps printing cash. Then low quality short form video apps started getting hot in China (like Tik Tok cancer), with huge VC money backing the muvfuckas pretty much plastered ads everywhere, taking time away from YY, is this sustainable? Low quality short form content is extremely difficult to monetize, sources tell me profitability is ass. But doesn't matter, when ad loads are low people flock to it. So YY user growth slows.

YY has also been incubating HUYA, basically YY focusing on esports, it's only meaningful competition is Douyu, and back in 2017 botj companies got a meaningful investment from Tencent. People were excited about it initially, stock popped premarket then started tanking cuz YY essentially sold 50% of its fast growing subsidiary that masks the stagnating YY platform for cheap. Back then people were also afraid of Douyu, which doesn't have the operational experience of YY, and new numbers (it's trying to IPO) shoes that it's ass even though it had a sizable lead over HUYA at the time of Tencents investment. 

But doesn't matter, damage has been done. YY got lowballed by Tencent  on the investment and the shares are trapped in the parent (not distributed) so there is a conglomerate discount. 

All this time execs at YY has been eyeing international expansion. I mean twitch sloots are everywhere, so the model is easily replicable. So the company seeds another streaming site called Bigo and is dominating India and SEA market. Bingo basically does everything YY and HUYA AND short form video under various brands. Basically this bitch covers everything.

YY rode along for a while and recently acquired the whole company for cash and stock in March. Good news, BIGO MAU was up a bigly 160% in Q1, bad news, losses made up 25% of YY's operating income. 

What does the above mean? Management didn't make any friends with these transactions. First the company sells half of HUYA for pennies to Tencent, goes public and doesn't distribute the stock, YY's own platform's slowing growth becomes apparent, stock tanks from $140. Value investors buy some at the bottom, company was cheap as shit on a sum of parts basis, tons of cash and growing in high single digits. Then company acquires BIGO, diluting ownership and lowering EPS, now those same value investors are shitting their pants because they can't comprehend long term investment. Stock does whole lotta nothing for couple of months, trading alongside tariff news and other bullshit. 

Most recently the company closes $1b converse notes with conversion in the high 90s, again diluting shareholders. 

This is where we at today. People are still uncertain about BIGO, YY growth is slowing, stake in HUYA not being valued fairly because  it's not being fully separated. Slap on Chinese fears and this boi is trading like ass even though Twitch sloots are a totally untapped commodity around the world."

Water infrastructure: companies like tyler technologies that make water infrastructure technology and monitoring systems. Water efficiency technology, recycling etc. 

ALTS: lets go over alt investments, Land in the northern US states and canada is going to be $$$$$$$$$ for the long game. Look at places that will never put into place a Land Value Tax. Just buy empty land in bum ass nowhere Montana and sit on that.

anything around the equator, coastal cities in poor countries (lol cant afford wall), and if it's possible short human rights because the realpolitik aspirations of nation states wont be able to uphold those anymore. It's either maintain global power or help poor non-citizens.

* A positive all time.

I wrote my first draft of this post on Friday so I had to rewrite pretty much the whole thing because of tariff man. 

&amp;#x200B;

$SPX- ***EXTREMELY BULLISH*** 

I am very confident that we will see an immediate rally at open, and then have it level out throughout the day/week because orange man said “trade talks with China are going very well” at G20. I’m planning to buy a bunch of calls at open and then possibly selling by noon depending on how well they perform. 

&amp;#x200B;

$BYND- ***BULLISH***

Many of you autists are familiar with this one. I bought some $152.5 ITM calls for no real reason other than them being cheap on Friday as the stock dropped 1.27%. Obviously, I’m bullish only for the short term, They’re way to overbought. It’s pretty ridiculous for a fake meat company. I’m definitely gonna sell on Monday if I see any kind of profit (something not too common here), as I don't foresee a big rise this week. 

&amp;#x200B;

$REAL- ***BULLISH***

The stock jumped a whopping 44% the day it IPOed (Friday). Most people predicted this because of the founders previous IPO history. By the time we actually can trade options on this stock, I could turn bearish if the stock becomes too overbought, but for at least the next week, I'm bullish.

&amp;#x200B;

$AAPL- ***BEARISH*** 

My position on Apple is obviously mostly due to Jony Ive leaving the company and them moving production of the Mac Pro to out of the US. I currently have $2.5k in 210 ITM puts expiring on the 5th. I don't expect a big crash or anything so if I see some gains by mid-week or even mid-Monday I'm probably going to take it and run. At this point, the only reason I can think of for a possible rise in Apple stock would be due to the trade talks with China, as the tariffs would heavily affect Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

$DIS- ***BULLISH***

The stock peaked this week at $141.18. I expect it to go down to at least $138 by mid-week mostly due to Toy Story 4 not doing as well as predicted. I currently have $7k in 135 ITM calls. I hope to sell on Wednesday’s open.

&amp;#x200B;

$UBER- ***BEARISH*** 

The stock went up 2.77% just Friday. The stock is too overpriced, and the company is way too overvalued for a company that for whatever reason doesn't seem to have a path to profitability. Overall, I’m bearish on this stock for both the short term and the long term.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, only 6 stonks this week. This took me well over an hour so please give me some free internet points. I have a lot of thoughts on some of the earnings this month, so I’ll definitely start doing this weekly to take the place of the legendary u/SoRefreshing.

263,t3_c7vivb,"I've just started with trading 2 months ago, now starting thinking what will this do at next tax season. I've looked online about how capital gains work, wash sales, long/short term gain taxation etc.

&amp;#x200B;

However, I have some questions as it's not totally clear.

&amp;#x200B;

Are losses/gains calculated on total amount of invested/traded or on individual trades? So if I make money on one trade of stock X, but then lose on a second trade of the same stock - will I be assessed on the total mount and outcome of those trades in sum?

&amp;#x200B;

What about different stocks - making profit on one and losing on another? Would I be taxed on individual gain?

265,t3_c7oqfn,"This is a second post in education on options I was planning to do weekly. It looks like bi-monthly now.

Same disclaimer:  there are plenty retards there who readily jump on and yell ""you're wrong, I know better""

Go ahead, be my guest.

To recap 3 guidelines from first post :

\- don't buy calls if you want to own stocks.

\- don't let options expire

\- call/put parity : buying calls = selling puts, selling calls = buying puts ( at first approximation at least)

Now is the next level ,

Options are called derivatives of stocks because their price is derived from the price of stock. Or even more specific the \_change\_ in price of options is derived from \_change\_ of stock price. There is some fancy formula to calculate it and feel free to ""discover"" it through google.

The first and most important component of that formula is 'delta' .

Delta is multiplier of stock price change.  E.g. if  stock price is 30$, then delta of at the money option  (strike = 30) is 0.5.

Why?  Because there is 50-50 chance that stock will go up or will go down. Delta is probability that stock will reach the strike price.

Is 0.5 a lot ? Well, let's do the math - $30 stock goes up $1 , 30 strike call option with expiration 2 months away will go 50 cents up.  If the original price of that call was $1 then it's now 1.50 - a 50% gain. Compare it to 3.3% gain in stock price. So for 1k investment you could buy 10 calls for $1 and get 1500 when you sell it. If you would buy stock you'd get 33 shares  and you would get 1033 when you sell them.  That's why we love'em .

Then it gets more interesting.

As I said 'delta' represent probability that stock would reach strike level. The crazy OTM options have tiny delta and their price doesn't change much - those who still keep their 60 MU calls know that their price stays pretty much the same. It's relatively stable investment now (until the other part of that formula - theta - will eat it out) . This is where YOLO game is played. Earnings are coming and you buy far OTM calls , earnings are great, stock price jumps and suddenly your calls are in the money  and now delta is substantial and you cash out and post screenshots.

Then there is a boring counterpart - deep in the money options. Their delta is close to 1 , they behave like stock. But they are still cheaper than stock.  And you can use the leverage here. Instead of buying 300 shares of APPL at 198 , you can buy 12 of 150 Calls (about 50 bucks a piece) , same 60k investment but now if APPLE goes up $1 , you get $1200 profit instead of 300. Well, if APPLE goes down $1 you are -1200 instead of  -300.

Nest step is to realize that with call (or put) at the money delta of 0.5 ( or -0.5 for puts) also represent risk of loss if stock goes the ~~wrong~~ usual direction. To minimize risk you can employ 'zero-delta' strategy - buy call and buy put at the same time , It's so popular that it got special name - 'straddle' if at the same strike, or 'strangle' if strikes are apart.  Any self respected autist here would tell you 'no risk, no gain' . Unless you sell short those straddles to autist next to you. There are a bit more complicated zero delta strategies (iron condor, butterfly etc). When 1r0nyman said box spread was 'risk-free' he meant it was zero-delta and he was right. Until he was wrong.    

And then there are combined stock+options strategies. Right now I am enjoying my 1.5 delta in WDC (stock + short put)  , my portfolio goes up like mushrooms after rain and I hope it will be green again soon.

Or you can sell short put and buy call and it will behave like stock but it will be cheaper.

You see, there are way more ways to lose money with options than just buying shares.

Stay liquid , keep paddling and don't listen to those idiots. Listen to me."

273,t3_c7g6zs,"Dish has been struggling for awhile now with declining TV subscribers and an abysmal streaming platform that has only 2.4 million subscribers.  Meanwhile, over the last 11 years, the company has been slowly accruing a treasure trove of expensive wireless spectrum that it isn't using.

According to the company's [May 03 10-Q filing]( the company has spent $11B over the last decade acquiring wireless spectrum licenses, and a further $10B in licenses bought through ""non-controlling investments"".

Due to the US government's push to roll out 5G, the FCC has imposed build-out requirements on spectrum distributed in the 700MHz band.  Spectrum is broken up into chunks which are auctioned to wireless companies under the expectation that these companies invest the money required to actually build out a network in this bandwidth.

In 2012, after two small satellite phone companies went bankrupt, Dish purchased their assets.  These assets included a chunk of spectrum that the US Government had given the companies for free in an effort to grow the satellite phone market.  DISH lobbied the government to expand this spectrum to allow for terrestrial use, under the agreement that it would begin rolling out its own network as a competitor to the major telecommunications providers.

In 2015, a DISH subsidiary made a $10B ""non-controlling"" investment in Northstar Spectrum and SNR Wireless.  Both companies bid at an FCC auction for AWS-3 spectrum and received a $3B (25%) discount due to their size, with the obligation that both companies meet the build-out requirements.  After the FCC uncovered that these companies were tied to DISH, the companies had $3B of spectrum (equivalent to their discount) revoked and DISH was forced to pay a $515M fine.  DISH is actively [appealing this decision]( back at the FCC to try and prove that it never controlled these entities in an attempt to try and win back their revoked spectrum.

The FCC granted DISH all of these licenses to use spectrum with the expectation that DISH build out massive mobile broadband. So far, DISH has come up short on these build-out requirements, leading to speculation that is sitting on these bands, hoping to resell it when 5G bandwidth gets hot.  Due to its failure to meet recent critical deadlines, its 700E and AWS-4 bandwidth deadlines were moved forward by one year, requiring 70% coverage in their respective areas by March 7, 2020.  Its 10MHz build-out deadline was moved up to April of 2022.

In response, the company says it plans to spend $1B to build out a 5G network ""focused on supporting narrowband Internet of Things"", of which the first phase is anticipated to be completed in March 2020.  However, they initially promised that this spectrum would be used for mobile broadband. DISH claims they plan to upgrade the network to support broadband another 2 years later in 2022, or 13 years after they first started buying this bandwidth.  A failure to meet these deadlines will result in the revocation of licenses, depending on the extent at which the network was built.  If DISH only builds out 10% of the network, the FCC may revoke its license in the other 90%.

DISH currently holds $\~40B of spectrum assets, with $15B of debt and $2B of cash with which to build out a network and meet the FCC's requirements.  [It has more mid-band spectrum than Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint]( \-- second only to AT&amp;T -- with no network to use it.  Analysts are hugely skeptical of DISH's ability to build out the infrastructure in time to meet the deadline.  There is also a growing concern that the spectrum assets aren't worth as much as Ergen was betting.

Along comes Sprint and T-Mobile.

The recent merger proposal of Sprint and T-Mobile draws a lot of concern over antitrust issues.  In an effort to appease the Justice Department, the two companies have agreed to sell a portion of their shared assets, including Sprint's own Boost Mobile and some spectrum.  The top bidder so far to the tune of $6 Billion: [DISH Network](  The Justice Department is looking on this purchase favorably, as it sees DISH as the best opportunity for a 4th carrier in the US, simply due to the huge amount of unused spectrum it's squatting on. Publicly, DISH hopes to finally put its spectrum to use through Sprint and T-Mobile's own network via Boost, effectively using the $6B to buy him more time to build out a network -- or squat on it some more.

290,t3_c71bmw,"Gather round lads, I’m about to explain why the market liked the G20 meeting, risk and opportunities analysis, unknowns, and what the proverbial “PriCeD iN” really means. 

Now some of you desk junkies just finished your business degree at state and graduated from flipping bitches to flipping options but soon you’ll be working on projects. Projects report status. Try as you might, you can’t get away from this. Status is often reported to executive leadership so don’t let leadership think you’re retarded because you can’t grasp these concepts. If it’s any consolation though, they may think you’re retarded anyways.

Markets, just like projects, are evaluated using many measurements which all can pretty much be boiled down to return on investment. The consensus price is determined by a fair valuation baseline, less risks, plus opportunities, with unknowns acting as volatility dial or a kind of standard deviation of sorts. 

Now I’ll get into this weekend. 

The market settled into the 290-295 range leading up to G20. This range had 3 main G20 components priced in.

G20 R/Os

1) Risk - unproductive talks, further tariffs, deteriorating relationship

2) Opportunity - trade deal agreement

3) Unknowns - could be anything.. Xi and Trump realize their queer tendencies and giggle like schoolgirls deflating confidence in leadership or Trump scuffs Xis shoes leading to WW3, you get the idea. 

Now here’s the IMPORTANT part. This weekend, we mitigated a risk and worked past an unknown. We did not however lose an opportunity. While mitigating a risk and realizing an opportunity both move markets in the same direction they are actually very different events and should be viewed as such. 

Risks create downward pressure, opportunity creates upward pressure. The amount of pressure created is measured by the likelihood of the risk or opportunity being realized. This weekend was not about realizing that opportunity. It was about removing the risk. That opportunity, a trade deal, hasn’t gone anywhere. Just because it wasn’t realized this weekend doesn’t mean you should price it out. What you apparently should price out through is further trade war escalation.

295,t3_c7a8fu,"I had a theory last night about what might have gone down in the Trump-Xi meeting, from reading between the lines. When I cite a credible news source I put (FACT). The rest is conjecture. 

I think that the series of meetings Trump had with business leaders (including Tim Apple) and the hearings on tariffs a couple of weeks back actually convinced him that an additional round of tariffs on China would be bad for American business. He definitely believes in tariffs, but I think the message he received was “this much is actually going to harm the economy.” Trump does not want to harm the economy. It’s the strongest part of his presidency and his campaign (whether you agree or disagree with specific policies/outcomes). 

But he had already announced that further tariffs would be implemented unless talks with Xi were productive. (FACT) If he abandoned the tariffs he would 1) look weak and 2) lose leverage. So he decided that, pretty much no matter what, he was going to refrain from the further tariffs. But he needed to try to get something out of Xi for it. 

So he initiated the meeting (FACT) with Xi, and Xi said he would only meet if they agreed that no further tariffs would be enacted regardless (Politico and SCMP reported but Trump disputed). Trump likely said it will take more than that to make him stop the tariffs. 

At the meeting, Trump likely reiterated all of his demands as an opening to the negotiation. Xi obviously declined, but in an effort to show 1) his willingness to work towards a solution and 2) to try to keep the talks open and avoid further tariffs, Xi offered things he was willing to give- i.e. buying more American shit. He’s never had a problem with this concession. I’m not sure if they discussed Huawei, but it’s possible Trump agreed to loosen the restrictions as a compromise. Both sides have something to take away from the talk without giving any ground on the key issues (IP and tariffs mostly, from what I can tell). 

They likely tried to discuss further items but didn’t actually get anywhere. This is why there has been no solid update on any items, but a positive sentiment from both sides. They agree to keep the talks going, because both economies were hurt when they were not talking. This gives them the opportunity to at least join the rest of G-20 in signaling more global cooperation, even if nothing has actually changed. 

So I don’t think this is hugely positive or negative. This is why I think we have maybe a small green day Monday for the risk-off but no rocket ship to the moon. 

Tldr: Trump didn’t want to put more tariffs on anyway after speaking to American business leaders but didn’t want to look weak or give up leverage so he tried to make out like his decision to not impose tariffs was because Xi cooperated and talks went well, when really nothing substantive has changed."

300,t3_c71fct,"Good afternoon and happy Saturday to all of you here on r/wallstreetbets. I hope everyone on this subreddit made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning July 1st, 2019.

# **What to watch in markets for the week ahead: After G-20, focus shifts to jobs report  - [(Source)](
*****
&gt; The monthly jobs number is always important but this time, it could be even bigger news, since it may actually help tell us how much the Fed will cut interest rates this summer.
*****
&gt; The report won’t be the only bit of data the Fed will look at before it meets July 30-31, but it could show whether the economy has hit a weak enough streak in hiring that the Fed will want to act.
*****
&gt; Economists expect that 158,000 jobs were created in June, up sharply from the disappointing 75,000 in May, according to Refinitiv. The unemployment rate is expected to remain unchanged at 3.6% and average hourly earnings are expected to rise by 0.3%.
*****
&gt; “It’s going to be better than last month. Otherwise, we’ve got a problem,” said Joseph LaVorgna, chief economist at Natixis Americas. “We’re saying it’s something like 130,000. If it’s weak, the markets are going to assume the Fed’s going 50 [basis points]. If you have a number in June, like you had in May, they would go 50.”
*****
&gt; After the weekend’s G-20 headlines, the jobs report is the big focus for markets in the coming week, along with OPEC’s two-day meeting Monday and Tuesday. OPEC is widely expected to extend 1.2 million barrels a day in production cuts in a deal with Russia, and oil isn’t expected to react much, unless there’s a surprise.
*****
&gt; Markets also kick off the third quarter in the holiday-shortened Fourth of July week, after one of the best first halves in more than 20 years for stocks.
*****
&gt; The jobs report follows some other important data in the coming week, and comes as the slowing in the economy is taking a worrisome turn and beginning to hit some of the consumer-related data. A lagging indicator, the jobs data may provide some guidance on the well-being of consumers, which drive about 70% of the U.S. economy.
*****
&gt; Both consumer confidence and consumer sentiment readings in June were weaker amid concerns about trade. Consumer spending increased just 0.2% in May, leading some economists on Friday to slash their expectations for both consumption in the second quarter and second quarter economic growth. J.P. Morgan economists trimmed their second quarter GDP forecast to 1.5% from 1.9%
*****
&gt; The economy now exits the second quarter, and first half of the year, with some big doubts hanging over the outlook. That makes some of the data in the coming week, the first week of the third quarter, even more relevant. For instance, ISM manufacturing and PMI manufacturing data are released Monday. Both are important to the outlook or the manufacturing sector, which has been weak. Car sales are released Tuesday, and they will also be an important look into manufacturing and the consumer.
*****
&gt; “If the jobs number is good but let’s say the CPI and retail sales data turns out to be a lot softer, or GDP revised meaningfully down, it’s not just employment. The possibility of the Fed doing more than 25 [basis points] does not end with the employment report,” LaVorgna said.
*****
&gt; The May jobs report was an important turning point for markets, changing the minority view of some economists that the Fed could cut interest rates into a consensus expectation. But that consensus has not settled on when and how much the Fed will chop rate.
*****
&gt; The Fed signaled after its June meeting that it was leaning toward a cut, exiting its neutral posture, and that it could act soon if it had to.
*****
&gt; So the jobs report, “is important for better or worse. The market’s been bullying the Fed for the last couple of decades and if anything, it’s gotten even more powerful. If it’s weak, the market is going to push them to do more, but the Fed will be fearful of disappointing the market. They’ll also be fearful the economy is weak against the backdrop of trade uncertainty,” said LaVorgna.
*****
&gt; At this point, fed funds futures are pricing in a full quarter-point rate cut for the July meeting and a portion of a second cut. Economists mostly expect two cuts this year, whether starting in July or September, with another likely by either September or December.

# July 4th Market Returns

&gt; With the first half winding down to a close, Summer is in full swing as July 4th quickly approaches. While the days leading up to or after July 4th are usually on the quiet side with many people taking vacations, for the stock market, it is usually a relatively positive week. The chart below shows the S&amp;P 500's performance during the July 4th week measuring performance from the Friday before July 4th until the Friday after. In years where July 4th falls on a Friday or Saturday, we measure the S&amp;P 500's performance in the week leading up to July 4th.

&gt; For the July 4th week, going back to 1969, the S&amp;P 500 has seen an average gain of 0.32% with positive returns 60% of the time. In the charts below, we have also included green shading in years where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half (as it is this year). In those years, returns during the July 4th week have been much better with an average gain of 0.93% and positive returns 79% of the time. In fact, the last time the S&amp;P 500 was down during the July 4th week in a year where the S&amp;P 500 was up 10%+ in the first half was in 1986!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Similar to the July 4th week, the day before July 4th has also historically been positive but not nearly to the same degree. On those days, the S&amp;P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.04% with positive returns only slightly more than half of the time (54%). In years where the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the day before July 4th is considerably better, averaging a gain of 0.17% with gains 64% of the time.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; With people out celebrating the July 4th holiday, the hangover sets in after. As shown below, the average S&amp;P 500 change on the trading day after July 4th is a decline of 0.18% with gains only 42% of the time. In years when the S&amp;P 500 was up over 10% in the first half, the declines aren't as bad, but at -0.12% and gains only half of the time, they aren't positive either. This year the day after July 4th will also feature the June Non-Farm Payrolls report. That will be fun!

# Next Week's Economic Indicators - 6/28/19

&gt; In posts yesterday and Monday, we made note of the increasingly disappointing economic data out of the US relative to expectations so far in 2019. This week's data only added to the woes as the Citi Economic Surprise Index for the US now sits only 0.73% above its April low.

&gt; Over half of this week's releases came in worse than the prior period of estimates. The Chicago Fed's National Activity Index was the first release this week showing improvements from the April data and coming in above estimates, but the indicator is still showing contracting activity (reading below zero). The Dallas Fed's Manufacturing Activity index also was out on Monday showing far weaker results. Later in the week, on Thursday, the Kansas City Fed released their own manufacturing activity index completing our Five Fed Composite which is painting a bleak picture for the manufacturing sector. There was also a good amount of housing data this week with overall solid results including stronger than expected home prices (via the FHFA index and S&amp;P CoreLogic's Case-Shiller Index) but disappointing new home sales on Tuesday, improved MBA Mortgage Applications on Wednesday, and a much better Pending Home Sales print on Thursday. Chicago PMI dropped below 50 on Friday, which is a sign of contraction, but Michigan Confidence beat estimates. One other major release this week was the third and final release of quarterly GDP, which held steady at 3.1% QoQ but was below estimates of an increase to 3.2%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Despite a shortened week due to the July 4th holiday, next week is set up to be a busy one. On Monday, Markit will release their final June PMI on manufacturing alongside the ISM reading later that morning. While Markit measures on manufacturing are expected to hold steady at 50.1, ISM data is anticipated to fall 1.1 down to 51. The only release Tuesday will be data on vehicle sales, which are expected to fall to 17 mm SAAR. On Thursday, there will be no releases and US markets will be shuttered in observance of the July 4th holiday. Additionally, markets will close early (1:00 PM EST) on Wednesday. In spite of this shortened session and day off, there is a huge slug of data to be released Wednesday. Following up the manufacturing PMIs, Markit and ISM non-manufacturing indicators are all due out on Wednesday. In the late morning, final May data on Factory, Durable, and Capital Goods Orders are also going to be released. Alongside the standard Wednesday release of MBA Mortgage Applications, other weekly data that is typically released on Thursday will be pushed ahead one day including Initial Jobless Claims and Bloomberg Consumer Comfort. ADP employment numbers are expected to show improvements when it releases on Wednesday ahead of Friday's Nonfarm payrolls report, which is also forecasting a solid improvement from the previous month.

# Trend Analyzer - 6/28/19 - Teetering On Overbought

&gt; After the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) set a new all-time high last Thursday, stocks have yet to make a push back above these levels as all of the major index ETFs sit below where they were at last Thursday's close. This pullback was partially a function of the large-cap major index ETFs like the Russell 1000 (IWB) working off overbought levels. Whereas all of these were overbought last week, currently only the Dow (DIA) still sits in overbought territory although other large caps are teetering on joining DIA. The Core S&amp;P Small Cap (IJR) and Micro Cap (IWC) are only lower by 0.41% and 0.33%, respectively. These are smaller losses compared to other ETFs which lost around 1%. Ironically, this outperformance also comes as IJR and IWC are now showing sideways trends rather uptrends across the rest of the ETFs. Granted, not all small-cap indices have been outperforming. Another small-cap index, the Russell 2000 (IWM), has seen performance more inline with other ETFs, declining 1.07%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Every sector except Materials (XLB) is lower over the last week. As shown in our Trend Analyzersnapshot below, it's the defensives that are finally lagging, with Real Estate (XLRE) down 4% and Utilities (XLU) down 2% since last Thursday's close. At the moment, only Materials and Health Care are overbought, while the rest are neutral.

# US Falls to the Bottom of the Pack

&gt; In a post earlier this week, we provided an update to the Citi Economic Surprise indices broken out by region. With economic data in the US continuing to disappoint this week, the Citi Surprise index (percentage of economic indicators that are beating vs. missing estimates) for the US is coming increasingly close to taking out its late April low and declining to its lowest levels in two years. What's also notable about the current reading is that at the most recent reading of -67.5, the surprise index for the US is more negative than any other country or region that this series tracks.

&gt; Below we compare the Citi surprise reading for the US and Europe over the last twelve months, and what a reversal it has been. Heading into 2019, economic data in the US was coming in much better relative to expectations versus Europe, but ever since then, data in the US has been getting progressively worse relative to expectations, while data in Europe has been consistently improving.

# July’s First Trading Day—Most Bullish Day, S&amp;P 500 has Advanced 85.7% of the Time

&gt; July’s first trading day is the best performing first trading day of all twelve months with DJIA gaining a cumulative 1,175.74 points since 1998. Over the past 21 years, DJIA’s first trading day of July has produced gains 81.0% of the time with an average gain of 0.40%. S&amp;P 500 has advanced 85.7% of the time (average gain 0.42%). NASDAQ has been slightly weaker at 76.2% (0.26% average gain). No other day of the year exhibits this amount of across-the-board strength which makes a solid case for declaring the first trading day of July the most bullish day of the year over the past 21 years.

# Pre-Election Year July Performance Mixed

&gt; July historically is the best performing month of the third quarter however, the mostly negative results in August and September make the comparison easy. Two “hot” Julys in 2009 and 2010 where DJIA and S&amp;P 500 both gained greater than 6% and a strong performance in 2013 have boosted July’s average gains since 1950 to 1.2% and 1.1% respectively. Such strength inevitability stirs talk of a “summer rally”, but beware the hype, as it has historically been the weakest rally of all seasons (page 74, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2019).

&gt; July begins NASDAQ’s worst four months and is the third weakest performing NASDAQ month since 1971, posting a 0.5% average gain. Dynamic trading often accompanies the first full month of summer as the beginning of the second half of the year brings an inflow of new capital. This creates a bullish beginning, a soft week after options expiration and strength towards the end.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](

&gt; Pre-election-year July rankings are something of a mixed bag, ranking #6 for DJIA and #7 S&amp;P 500, averaging gains of 1.0% and 0.9% respectively (since 1950); while NASDAQ (since 1971) and Russell 1000 (since 1979) pre-election Julys both rank #8. NASDAQ has only advanced in six of the last twelve pre-election Julys. Russell 2000 has advanced in five of its last ten. Despite tech’s and small-cap’s meager pre-election July track record, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have averaged gains of 0.9% and 0.3% respectively.

What are you all watching for in this upcoming holiday-shortened week ahead?

I hope you all have a fantastic weekend and a great trading week. Happy (early) 4th of July r/wallstreetbets!"
301,t3_c761v2,Seriously considering becoming a resident of Puerto Rico to reap the tax benefits on capital gains. A 100-200k condo could easily pay for itself at 37% tax. I’m interested if anyone has ever done this before I embark on this journey.
302,t3_c72n41,Cocaine Is Back. Blame Technology for It.  
303,t3_c76ptb,"Not many people are familiar with Howard Hughes - ticker HHC. Well I had this shit stock for a long ass time bc I’m retarded (Mr Howard was once richest homie alive). News came out that they were looking at an opportunity for a sale of the company and it went up 41% - like 92 to 131. On Friday the stock fell to about 123. I sold everything at 127.... (ima cleansed man, thank god, god bless)

For those autists who have been posting about them losing ridiculous amounts of money when the market is nearing all time highs (not a god damn clue how ppl are pulling that off) let me give you some advice and all you have to do is INVERSE THIS ADVICE. Buy Howard Hughes. 


For the retards not catching the hint...that means puts....

311,t3_c6t954,"I'm calling it: with this week's pop in the Industrials and Banking sectors, there is not a single company in the S&amp;P500 that is undervalued.

&amp;#x200B;

Name one.

&amp;#x200B;

Micron? China stole their IP and will have have a domestic production by 2020.

&amp;#x200B;

Kraft Heinz? They sell ketchup and accounting fraud.

&amp;#x200B;

Nucor? The last remaining steel company on the index. Let's see if that wall ever gets built.

&amp;#x200B;

GM? 10 years ago they were making shit vehicles and went bankrupt. The vehicles are still garbage, they just have less UAW fucks on the payroll.

Macy's? Christ I'm preaching to the choir on this one.

313,t3_c6uod6,"Worth reading the entire thing. Shows that even intel is worried about AMD catching up to intel.

For the first time you have a CPU lineup that is competitive in all aspects, not only multicore, but also single core. Before, AMD might have only appealed to Budget and workstation users, AMD can appeal to every single part of the market. Leaks show that AMD is either on par, or even beating intel, at a much lower price point. Intel has slashed prices as a result. 

OEMs are starting to choose AMD over Intel, as they start seeing cost savings, at no impact to performance.

Laptops, a market traditionally locked down by intel, also facing a rise in AMD based devices.

Finally, servers. Intel makes most of their tendies on servers, where they can jack up the prices because there is no real competition. AMD has also come in, guns blazing, with server chips that are finally worth paying attention to. Google's stadia (game streaming service) is running off of AMD. Fixes to recent CPU vulnerabilities like meltdown, spectre, Rowhammer, all (significantly) affect Intel computing performance, something that enterprise customers care about a lot. AMD has been a lot more uptight about their security.

Intel has a market cap of 200 bil, while AMD has a market cap of 30 bil. AMD is definitely not going to 200 bil, but there is room for growth.

Concerns: P/E ratio of AMD is a little high, 121 vs Intel's 10. Could be a little overpriced, considering how a lot of investors realize the value in AMD. P/E ratio of 40 is normal in semiconductors.

However, considering room for future, explosive growth, I think it literally can't go tits up.

Long AMD, price target $60 (if you hold) I'll probably hold for 4 months.
Disclaimer: I own shares of AMD"
315,t3_c6sbhs,"I’ve been playing with stocks for just at 2 years now and have managed to lose $12,000. Penny stocks and panic selling is my biggest enemy but I just lost $3k this week on call options.  I have right around $1,000 left with some of that tied up in calls that expire 7/12 and 7/19.

Luckily I’m not dependent on this money, but it is also a big chunk of change for me. 

Who here can give me a solid YOLO to help me come back from this hell hole?

Edit: replaced “investing” with “playing with stocks”. Also, I get that I fucked up in that I kept throwing money at the problem without changing my strategy, hence why I lost so much money. Almost every play I’ve done started with a profit and quickly fell to a loss. I got greedy. Clearly, I need to change strategy. This post was just to see if someone can make a better move than I can bc I clearly make plays at the worse time. 

I appreciate both the lighthearted and negative comments. I need both."
316,t3_c6rk16,"Anyone know what they're having for breakfast? I need updates each time someone uses the restroom, what brand toothpaste are they brushing their teeth with?

UPDATE: THEY ARE MEETING 

UPDATE: After an 80-minute meeting Trump tells reporters that U.S. and China ""back on track"" and negotiations will continue."
318,t3_c6oo5j,"My brain runs on windows vista so the other day I impulse bought a JNUG put option but it said something like JNUG +1 and I didnt know what that meant but bought it anyway. Now I'm up like 4000% but the strike price is 11.50 and JNUG is at 59.91 and rising. Please put a helmet on me and explain as monosyllabically as possible what I did.

"
320,t3_c703qg,"Coded references to the fine folks of WSB, no doubt

&gt; Mr. Trump touted China’s willingness to buy large amounts of U.S. farm goods as a big benefit of the truce. He said China would begin immediate purchases of American goods and will be “spending money even during the negotiations.”

&gt; On Friday, before Messrs. Trump and Xi sat down for their discussions, China purchased 544,000 metric tons of soybeans, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.

&gt; While Mr. Trump’s trade negotiators have said they are focusing on structural change in China—such as ending pressure on U.S. firms to transfer technology to their Chinese competitors—Mr. Trump has frequently stressed increased exports instead. The president counts on rural America as a bedrock of support and farmers have taken the brunt of retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries hit with U.S. levies.

&gt; The Trump administration has made billions of dollars in payments to compensate farmers for lost sales. At the press briefing, Mr. Trump called farmers “green patriots.”

&gt; In another nod to Chinese concerns, Mr. Trump said he welcomed Chinese students studying in the U.S. and hoped many would remain after their studies were over. He talked about what he called a “smart persons waiver,” which could help such students get permanent U.S. residency. Chinese students and scholars say it has become more difficult for them to get visas to study in the U.S.

325,t3_c6syfq,"I've posted before about why Coca-Cola will fail. But here's another reason:

Just talked to a senior manager of a fairly large restaurant. I asked if he was excited about the new Orange Vanilla flavor and asked if they ordered any. The answer:

""No.""

I was a little surprised. In fact, they had actually just put in order for more Pepsi products. Why? Because they use Pepsi soft drinks (soft drink moat) and soda dispensers made for Pepsi products.

Sorry guys, but I'll repeat: Coca-Cola has NO chance. It's all smoke and mirrors which will come burning down in a few quarters when Coke, once again, will show no sustained revenue growth. Look at quarterly revenue for the last 10 years. Its a noisy horizontal line. These restaurants don't want to switch to Coke, only to have to switch back to Pepsi again in a year when Pepsi gets their act together and drops their New Pepsi which crush Coke."
326,t3_c6sw0m,"&amp;#x200B;

[4\/20 to 6\/28](

I started trading on IB after getting screwed over more than a few times on Robinhood, nothing but good things to say about IB, sorry WSB for the ugly graph.

&amp;#x200B;

Breakdown of my graph(4/20-6/28):

4/20-5/22- Nearly exclusively traded UGAZ/DGAZ, did daily/nightly chart readings, did hours of research on the fundamentals, studied, kept my mind straight by doing lots of cardio, good foods &amp; keeping myself in check. Would average 60$-300$ a day scalping UGAZ/DGAZ, no overnight holds, typical move lasted maybe an hour at most, often times just a few minutes if not less. Made maybe 2500$ or so from a few yolo plays I got from buddies, but otherwise pretty straight-edge natty gas scalping, which leads me to my next phase...

&amp;#x200B;

5/22- Natural Gas PLUMMETED to levels which in retrospect I should've seen coming, due to mass overproduction, and a relatively cool summer lowering demand. I get caught holding a bag at the worst possible moment during the year, panic(I don't use a stop loss because autism), and end losing $4,000 in just a few days. At the time, I was mortified, something had to be done.

5/31-Make a huge YOLO play on natural gas, throwing out what I knew and end up losing another $2800 in a flash. In a panic, and having been influenced by a friend making 600% on a option play earlier that week, I decide fuck it, and do a call option on Kroger for June 21st 2019 @ 23.5 for .80 cents for 222 contracts. I now have $17k fully riding on the premise that Kroger will move up. I was swinging for the fences and knew it, and couldn't remember my heart rate being more jacked for what seemed like forever. End up drinking my ass off that weekend to forget about trading for a while.

6/4- Whattaya know, Kroger ends up moving up a whole dollar by time the market opens on Tuesday, and I cut my option, and walk out with 7k. Wooh, back to my initial and then some, time to slow my roll right? Wrong.

6/4-6/7-Options have fully taken over my brain. End up losing 4k on horrible and ill-timed weekly options on Amazon and Costco after my big win. Can't think clearly, getting desperate, and decide I need another hail mary play. End up rolling a call on Facebook &amp; Microsoft,  and they almost immediately become profitable after I buy them. Of course about an hour later, Microsoft starts to plummet for no reason at all, and then a article comes out stating that Mark Zuckerberg knew about the privacy issues for years and was lying about it. Facebook stock immediately drops, and before I know it both my options are underwater.

&amp;#x200B;

6/10-6/13- Quite possibly the longest week of my life. Both Microsoft and Facebook continued to drop, or at best pop up slightly and stagnant. At one point during the week, my account which had started at 29k just a month and a half ago read the net liquidation value at $8500. I started to drink myself to sleep. At one point on 6/13 I had an opportunity to get out with my NLV at $26,000, a loss of merely a couple thousand. I didn't take it, and it promptly dropped back down to 13k NLV.

6/14-Facebook comes out Libra coin, and Microsoft unfucks themselves in a flash. Facebook pops up about 12$ in nearly an instant immediately after market open, and I did a market sell on both options at 8:35AM, and end up profiting 600$. My account is nearly back to where I started, at $28.5k. Lesson learned: Options are nothing to mess with.

6/17-6/18- Try to start back scalping, but this time with options. I started conservative on Monday, got my account profitable again, and then the next day the worst thing happened: I made $8,000 dollars in approximately two hours. I am now completely hooked.

6/19- Run a call option on Home Depot, which was technically profitable, but didn't have enough liquidity on it and I end up turning what should have been a easy $2.5k gain into a $3k loss. Shoot, but I made the right call, just a minor detail I was unaware of, no biggie...

6/20-Run a put option on Costco, Costco ends up running up during the day, and at one point I'm down $8k, but not even phased at this point. Sure enough, towards the last 20 minutes of the day, Costco plummets, and I do a market sell when I see that I was profitable, if only slightly, but end up turning a 600$ gain into a 4k loss because I'm a retard and couldn't wait another 2 minutes. I shit you not, not two minutes after I sold that put, Costco dropped another 4 dollars, which would have made my Put nearly 150% profitable, but alas, I end up limping away 4k poorer.

6/21-6/25- Do more conservative scalps and straddles on Amazon,Costco,Tesla, and feel confident now that I'm profitable again. See that Gold is booming, and decide to run a call on Silver as I see it's lagging. End up losing about 4k in a few days due to impatience, and start to get desperate again...

6/26-Am awared that Boeing is having new issues after the market closes(again!) and decide now is a good time to buy a put the next day when the time feels right.

6/27-Hear more bad news about Boeing with software troubles, but don't think it's a big deal, and can see the stock has already recovered 15$ since the AH plummet the previous day. When the market opened, Boeing immediately shot up to 369, and I decided I should throw on a put and get out ASAP. I second guess myself, throw on a Call option for 375 that expired Friday. I lost 7k in less than 48 hours, and my account is locked.

&amp;#x200B;

And here I am, on a Friday night, realizing how I gave myself a potent gambling addiction. All told, I have lost nearly $20,000 in the last 8 days.

&amp;#x200B;

My plan now is go all out one last time, on a 3-month out call or put on either HD or LOW. I can't think properly, I feel like a junkie and my heart sometimes hurts from what I can only imagine are massive spikes in anxiety, but I'd rather fight the good fight than go down like a pussy. No one ever remembers the guy who threw it all in an index fund.

334,t3_c6o8fw,"S3 back from vacation and posted this update: 

BYND short interest is $883 mm; 5.42 mm shares shorted; 46.27% of float; 132% borrow fee. Shs shorted are up +11k, +0.20%, in June as its stock price rose +56.46%. Over the past week shs shorted decreased by -162k, -2.90%, as its stock price rose +0.34%.

New Borrows are charging 100-150% today. According to S3, of stocks with more than $50m in short interest, BYND has the highest borrow rate. 

&amp;#x200B;

5.42m shares shorted of a float of 11m. This is down slightly from a few days ago when it was 5.94m. The avg short borrow rate of 132% is up slightly from 115% on June 25th. However new borrows are getting charged 100-150%, well below the borrow rate of 250-350%. He still sees short supply as tight and this is a lender's market. From what I've been seeing when I call around, borrow rates fell from yesterday's 200% range to today around 122%. 

&amp;#x200B;

So probably the run up this week was a mini-squeeze. A true squeeze would see the shares shorted fall by probably 10-20% on an absolute basis.

&amp;#x200B;

Options traders come in one of these three groups:

1) Informed traders - This group is insiders (those with private information) and person do really do their DD.  This is a small percent of option traders but they comprise a large portion of winnings, just like how the top 10% of people owns 85% of the world's wealth.

2) Hedgers - This group is taking insurance on their portfolio. In the long-run, this group's net winnings is zero.

3) Speculators - This group is people who are gambling and randomly picking earnings releases and guessing a direction it will go.  They are also generally autistic.  Sound familiar?

So if hedgers break-even, the sum of all the moneys won by informed traders must be absorbed the average WSBer.

347,t3_c6m7pk,"Trump already secured the US a good position, and he won't back down or compromise for less of the current tariff level. What could make Trump and his team pull out?  Strong and vengeful pushbacks from China, perhaps.

But that kinda pushback has NEVER been the case since the tariff war started (despite what appear to be retaliation tariffs by China ). There was no trade war, and it actually is the beginning of shifting manufacturers from China to Vietnam, India, and the US. This shift is inevitable, as Xi knows.

&amp;#x200B;

Xi and his commie bros condemn protectionism lead by the US, along with reclaiming global trade networks as a bene system.  China cheated the WTO so it's kinda rich now. If the existing global trade networks tilt to the side of bilateral agreements between countries, China will be left as the untrustworthy cheater in the game. That's why they created their own game-The Belt and Road Initiative.

&amp;#x200B;

The manufacturing shift is unstoppable, but possible to reduce its speed. China is smart on procrastinating the talks, and Trump has granted them several extensions. But these extensions are far from enough for China to establish their new game. Xi needs more time, not conflicts.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let us focus on this weekend's Trump-Xi meeting. A trade deal will be made, because:

\- China will not comply literally, just as what they did to WTO and all other shits they promised

\- A trade deal with the US will encourage more countries to join China's Belt and Road game, and it buys China more time to lure more players in

\- US companies in China need to pull out before major confrontations after the shift

\- 2020 is still a possible break for China to have a new opponent (pro-China or not); it's safer to act tough after November 2020( talking tough means no shit)

\- China needs foods from the US, at least before they finish their ""Prussian Potato Reform""-a term by yours truly

\- Trump needs this for reelection chips to stack up; China will break all promises to make him look petty before the election.

So, I loaded up calls and S&amp;P futures today."

Close shit before things get bad. Before going long on these, I was previously up about $11k with ES and NQ via scalping. For some stupid reason I decided to go long and hold. The P/L day including other positions on the way down was over -$41k on one of the worst days, and it wasn't quite near the low yet.

I was so close to closing everything that day because it got so ugly and I was beginning to feel uncomfortable. It was the literally the last day before things started rebounding. That would have sucked, and was the main reason why I didn't close sooner. Don't do that. Either have a stop loss long before shit gets bad, or a mental one.

Currently I am long 1x ES and 2x NQ at the moment and will see how things go. May add or reduce. Plan to get back into scalping/swing trading futures rather than just holding too long.

351,t3_c6h9do,"1. If you think you have a better spread than a simple straddle or strangle, and have less than $10k to burn, don't sell premiums you can't cover as part of an options strategy. Better autists before you have done all-star DD and still ended up negative 5 figures that way.  

2. Never buy an option contract simply because you can afford it. This makes you a garbage person. Garbage people take burdensome leftovers that strangers want gone once a week  

3. Options calculator. Watching folks buy options confidently based on op interest/volume alone was a fun for a while, but if more WSBers used   [ we wouldn't need crisis hotline bot as much  

4. I now tend to only average down my losses when those losses are caused by temporary news (and if I have enough day trades to cut further losses if needed) .   

5. For fucks sake. Lay off the round trips for a week, actually give yourself a morsel of a chance.  


I'm not an emotional trader, but I did catch myself caught up in stupid PDT OCD this past month. Knew I needed to do some DD on myself.

Were either poor as fuck or rich as fuck.  You’ve seen how gold moves when it wants to.

So here’s our line up:

1. Does the Fed cut rates in July?
My answer: yes, a full .50 basis points
This would be the biggest win for gold. I’m talking kissing 1475 for /GC good alone on this. This is worth waiting for, lots of good reward here.

2. Does GDP and job numbers suck again?
I think at best they will be luke warm, but possibly they can be shitty again. They won’t be bang buster good.

3. 🐲 G-20: This one is a bit of a wild card. I know for a fact a deal will not be made, and optimism will cease from this, but I’m not sure if we will see a rally in gold? Possibly we can benefit from this from $DXY falling, which is good for gold. I’m not sure how fueling this event will be, even though we should favor from it as gold gang.

4. We could benefit from a market sell off any day lol. 

5. Were holding above 1400 like a champ. So the smart money is still here, consolidation is happening, so that’s good for us.

366,t3_c6lckh,"It was JNUG and it reverse split 1:5 last night. Now my account is saying I have the same value as it was yesterday, with the call options contracts being called JNUG1. Thing is, underlying JNUG is up 2.3% and my calls aren't increasing in value today. I read something saying that my new JNUG1 options might take longer to settle when I try to sell, which sounds bad. 

Also, I only had single 100x contracts, so it's not like I could have had 5 contracts turn into a single contract. I now have a fractional contract for only 20 shares?

Other thing is, these were leaps with a Jan 2021 expiration. Should I just roll these JNUG1 calls into new JNUG calls? I'd rather not, trying to hold for long term capital gains.

Oh yeah and I can't trade any JNUG options until I do something with these JNUG1 contracts. Literally can't."

381,t3_c67jqu,"I posted this earlier this morning and mods took it down. Not sure why?

&amp;#x200B;

Still nothing from S3 in terms of the amount of shares that are shorted (they didn't report yesterday either). But in calling around, I got short borrow rates at 282% at IB, up from 230% yesterday, with no available shares to borrow. Fidelity reported 99% borrow rate (with no available shares) but that is the max rate they charge. I believe Schwab does that as well (capping short borrow rates at 99%).

Other factors that I find encouraging:

1. Forced ETF buying due to Russell 1000 inclusion. Tracking funds might try to buy before the June 28th inclusion date, but they will essentially be forced buyers AFTER June 28th as well. The article below assumes about 2.6m shares will have to be bought. That is essentially 4% of the outstanding shares, but MORE IMPORTANTLY 24% of the entire float of 11m shares due to the lock-up which expires in October.

[

2) BYND is still on the ""fail to deliver"" threshold list at Nasdaq due to Regulation SHO. Many firms that shorted shares in BYND assumed that their PBs would be able to find shares to borrow. This is not always the case. My understanding is that a PB has 13 days to locate shares to deliver to their clients who are short the stock, otherwise they are forced to make their clients cover the shares. They first appeared on the list 12 days ago and hence day 13 SHOULD be June 28th.

3) Short Interest remains about 50% of the float with borrow rights trending higher. They move around day to day, but in my (admittedly) small sample size of calling around brokers, they seem to be trending higher with no available shares to borrow. This is a good thing.

So as of right now I am still holding my August 16th calls of $100, $140, and $200s due to the potential of a short squeeze. But I have a very high risk tolerance and I MAY BE WRONG. If you are buying calls or shares, please know that this is a super over valued stock in a bad business long term. This WILL crash and burn at some point. Please be aware of that and only risk what you assume you will lose.

I will update when S3 posts borrow rates (if they do)"
382,t3_c68ex8,"This is a list of the top 20 companies that experienced the largest change in insider shares in the last seven (7) days.
The SEC defines an insider as any officer, director or 10% shareholder. It is not illegal for these people to buy or sell their own shares.
In fact, since most of them get paid in stock options, it is expected. However, it is illegal for them to trade on inside information
that has not been made public. So for example if there are drug trial results that are bad and not public,
insiders cannot dump shares. That said, many people have observed that insiders - in general - seem to have a good
track record at timing their purchases.  All trades that are marked as part of a 10b5 plan are excluded from this report.

385,t3_c6awjj,Breaking news alert from CNBC.  Time to short?
386,t3_c655sp,"Good morning all

Yesterday was one of those days in the market where you have to sit on your hands and trust the big picture technical analysis we did the night before. Like normal, we got a pump based on trade talk news, but that quickly gave up and reversed giving up 80% of the move before market open. 

As you can see from the middle moving average (strategy videos coming soon!) we were able to stay under and continue bearish momentum the remainder of the day. Looking at /es futures last night, we have found the support from last Wednesday and will be testing that overnight. If that breaks, expect an open below SPY 290.00 and a move to continue bearish until the next support near 288 (/es 2889). If we bounce on support, expect a slightly green open around SPY 291.20 area. 

Our July 3rd 290p from Tuesday is looking really solid as we're up about ~30% at close. If that support fails overnight, we'll be in the money and looking for the exit to lock in profits later in the day.

389,t3_c64pa2,"Trump better come correct this time. The Chinese will never accept a deal where they lose face. They know that everyone and their dog knows China is #2 to America with ambitions of closing that gap. 

I won't say China will never agree to stopping forced ip transfers or all the other ways the state's agenda are intertwined with the private sector. But I can tell you no matter what is agreed on paper, if it is viewed as punitive to China, it will not be followed to that same degree in practice.

The way to deal with the Chinese is to understand just how important face is to almost every Chinese person. A good, quick case study in relation to how PRC gov't carries it in these types of impasse situations is the [1992 Consensus]( which established the ""One China"" principle. Now the kicker is both PRC China and then KMT China both agree that Taiwan is part of China, but because of how the terms of the consensus were deliberately drafted there was room for interpretation as to who is the one China, allowing both China's to save face in their agreement. The '92 Consensus would eventually amount to the de facto establishment of the PRC gov't as the one true China all the while still tacitly acknowledging Taiwan's ruling powers are strong enough to make for a costly invasion of the island, a dynamic that remains true today.

In the end, I'm hopeful Trump (but mostly the team around him) will be able to get it this time. But I'm still pretty skeptical that Trump can understand face beyond his own, let alone the sheer inertia a societal norm like face is to the Chinese. So really it's up to the Chinese to nice the guy into thinking he's winning the most which I'll bet my left nut (big one) that there's a Chinese proverb for this exact situation.

392,t3_c68f6w,"These are the latest Schedule 13D forms filed by activist investors in the last 7 days. Activist
investors are investors that make an investment with the intention of influencing management in some way.
There is evidence that following activist investors into investments can generate excess returns.
Schedule 13G forms, in contrast, are filed by significant investors with no intention of influencing management
(such as Index funds).

There is always a lot of interest in insider trades, but what a lot of people probably don't realize
is that hedge fund activity is probably more predictive of future returns than insider activity.
The reason is that hedge funds (a) have large research budgets, and (b) have a choice where to put their money.
In contract, insiders have no choice where to put their money, but only when to time their transactions.

Just talked to a senior sysadmin of a fairly large cluster. I asked if he was excited about AMD 7nm epyc chips and asked if they ordered any. The answer:

""No.""

I was a little surprised. In fact, they had actually just put in order for more Intel chips. Why? Because they use Intel compiler (software moat) and software which is optimized for Intel chips.

Sorry guys, but I'll repeat: AMD has NO chance. It's all smoke and mirrors which will come burning down in a few quarters when AMD, once again, will show no sustained revenue growth. Look at quarterly revenue for the last 10 years. Its a noisy horizontal line. These clusters don't want to switch to AMD, only to have to switch back to Intel again in a year when Intel gets their act together and drops their 10nm chips which crush AMD."

I have also watched videos from SPIEF, World Economic Forum, and I came to one fact: Russian Agriculture is the winner.  

Even if the trade war ends, China holds grudges.  I am confident they'll slowly shift their pork and dairy imports source to Russia.  Canadian meat is banned, and it's due to the certificate scandal.  Canadian canola also is banned due to some ""insecticide issue"". Another evidence of China's revenge trade is holding up Australia coal, and sending three battle ships after the 5G ban.  Mercedes had to kowtow to China when one of their employee accidentally quoted Dalai Lama for a car picture ad.

China is consistent, and I'm sure they will slowly shift their trade from America and Canada to Russia for agriculture.

442,t3_c5tvph,"Today, the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) struck down a two-year residency requirement for operators of liquor stores in the state of Tennessee. In so doing, the Court ruled that ``Under the dormant Commerce Clause cases, a  state law that discriminates against out-of-state goods or nonresident economic actors can be sustained only on a showing that it is narrowly tailored to advanc[e] a legitimate local purpose. Tennessee's 2-year residency requirement plainly favors Tennesseans over nonresidents'' ( So Total Wine (privately held) can now operate stores in Tennessee. 

The decision itself has narrow implications for the Tennessee market. But it has much bigger implications in another turf battle: Texas. Currently, Texas bars publicly-traded companies from holding liquor licenses ( In fact, the only ``chains'' that exist in Texas (Specs, Twins, etc.) exist because the licenses are distributed among members of the same family. The result is a byzantine set of laws that limits the marketplace to private companies. 

WMT has taken the lead in challenging these laws. The lawsuit started in 2015, with WMT claiming that the Texas law was an undue burden to out-of-state interests. That effort has been under appeal for years. Currently, the appeal sits at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ( The key: that court has been (allegedly) waiting for today's SCOTUS ruling to make its own ruling, since it's subject to the same doctrine. Since SCOTUS ruled that Tennessee was imposing an undue burden on inter-state commerce that wasn't sufficiently justified by a narrowly tailored local interest, the odds just went way up that the 5th Circuit will rule in favor of publicly held companies. 

The two most obvious winners from a ruling in favor of public companies would be WMT and COST. 

Why is this important? Three reasons. First: the Texas liquor market is valued at over $6 billion annually ( So being able to sell in the state would be a huge boon to business. Second: the ruling is expected to come by the end of the summer. Third: in the case of COST, most states prohibit the formation of ``clubs'' for liquor sales ( so you are usually able to buy alcohol without a membership. 

Lastly, WMT especially should be somewhat impervious to short-term economic news (bad economy = more Wal-Mart), so this would just be the icing on the cake for August calls."

A little bit different chart than you're used to, but if you attended the webinar I hosted yesterday you'll know why!

Earlier yesterday morning, /es futures (and SPY) confirmed a bearish reversal as all three moving averages crossed at the same point. The following 10 hours proved just how solid this cross really was by dropping quite a bit. I'm glad we were able to get into 3July 290p and I'm seeing an average ~30% profit into yesterday's close!

Looking at after hours, we're all ready seeing continuation bearish, but that move grabbed a quick support bounce so we'll be cautious watching the overnight and going into the morning market hours. That being said, the crossover says bearish, so that's the bias I will be playing with until proven otherwise.

&gt;Vanguard is evaluating partnerships to make a mix of private-equity funds available to Vanguard clients, the people said.  
&gt;  
&gt;The talks are in the early stages, and a final decision hasn’t  been made. It is possible Vanguard won’t offer a private-equity product  in the end.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Vanguard has told private-equity executives it is considering offering  private-market strategies to clients of its advisory services, two  people said. Its focus would likely be institutions and high-net-worth  clients that the firm advises, one person said. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Vanguard has over the years explored the idea of private equity. In 2001 the company announced it [struck a deal]( with Bala Cynwyd, Pa.-based [Hamilton Lane]( to launch a private-equity offering. The firm struggled to hit  fundraising targets in the aftermath of the dot-com bust. Vanguard  conceded in 2002 that it would be difficult to raise enough to be  cost-effective.

So this would lead to even more funding in the private markets that would be availible for startups and even bigger marketcap IPOs, if at all, in the future or not? Is the future of stock trading/investing in private shadow stock markets for institutional/accredited investors?

Losing the office may hurt a little netflix in the short run but I think it will help them in the future. They are paying a fuck ton of cash to keep it on air like friends. Losing it will loosen some cash to spend on new projects and thats what will help netflix in the long run.

Netflix is basically treated as a utility (I won’t put any sources because I’m lazy) so they have more downside protection then you guys think. When the office will be gone, it will be stale to those people that has been binge watching it for the last 7 years anyways. This will force people to watch the other content like netflix’s original exclusive content. There’s going to be some gems for sure like bird box where everyone will talk about it and makes memes and shit on it. That stuff sells a fuck ton of new subscriptions. 

Not every project will have that effect but netflix has a pretty solid and courageous management so they invest in studios that have ideas and balls like the studio that made birdbox.

I am still holding my August calls with the expectation that a short squeeze occurs in the next few weeks, but in the past couple weeks I've definitely been wrong."
480,t3_c5dafb,I hope you guys are eyeing MSFT. Jefferies issued a bearish note and it's now down 3.5%. I've taken a small call position (July 19/135) with the expectation that this rebounds over the next few days.

484,t3_c5ia1t,"Hey WSB. I just finished losing $8,000 over the course of a year or so (guess I'm an autist too?) from buying calls/puts and decided it's time to switch up my strategy. I'm going to start selling covered calls and puts and was wondering if there is a historically ideal time to sell covered calls and puts. What I mean by that is if there is an ideal time to be targetting from the point of selling a call/put to expiration?

Ie. Should I sell a BYND call with 2 weeks until expiration or 4 weeks? Or 12 weeks? Etc.

Obviously the conditions for what is truly ""ideal"" varies greatly from ticker to ticker, but I am curious if anyone has heard or know of a 'generally' good time span to begin targeting when looking to sell calls/puts...?

Or maybe I'm just retarded. Thanks."
485,t3_c5a1fm,"After Argentinia in June 2017 sold it's first 100 year bonds, Austria jumped on the train in September 2017 and sold them successfully for a coupon of 2.1%. Now they want to repeat it with a coupon of 1.2%.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If you wanted to buy any of those 2.1% 2117 Austria bonds right now,  you’d have to pay 60% more than their issue price; they’ve been a great  success. They currently yield about 1.12%, so that’s where you’d expect  any new 2119 offer would be pitched – if it comes. A new-issue premium  would probably take it up to close to 1.2%. 

&amp;#x200B;

So the bond buyers in 2017 got 60% profit in 2 years. I would expect other countries to follow. It seems to be a major sign of a bond market bubble. Trading those 100 year bonds at that low yields is like a game of hot potato.

What's next 500 year t-bonds? Futures on Mars colony bonds expiry in 2320?

488,t3_c586nj,"Good morning everyone and happy Tuesday!

Quite an uneventful day in the market as we expected from futures movement Sunday night. Being able to sit on the sidelines or trade quick positions for a small profit is key during these times. 

The overall movement is now working to use the channel median as support. If that holds, the likelihood of SPY 300 is much higher. If that level begins to fail Tuesday - Thursday of this week, we'll start to see the bears back in the market. Don't jump on the bear hype too quickly if that happens as there are still plenty of bulls who want 290 support to hold before that SPY 300 test. This simply means that if the channel median breaks, the probability of SPY 300 goes down drastically, but we won't be bearish unless SPY 290 fails and the bulls give up hope. Until that time, it's still safer to play the bullish trend until given a reason to switch.

My pick: Simon Property Group (SPG)
If I’m going to YOLO might as well pick a stock with strong fundamentals:

A rated balance sheet with low leverage as compared to peers

5% dividend yield

High tenant sales psf 

Best of breed management team

Tenant sales continue to grow - their properties are getting better

Anchor boxes like Sears going dark are redevelopment opportunities because they can chop it up and bring someone new

I see FFO growing 5-10% in the near term - a dividend growing at those rates shouldn’t trade at a 5% yield

Sentiment might stay poor in the near term until several quarters of strong earnings (they’ve had great earnings the past couple quarters)

My trade: LEAPS call spread
Jan 2021 expiration
$180-$185
Costs around $1.60
Maximum upside around 212%

Reasoning: by 2021 SPG should be paying a trailing dividend around $9 or higher - $185 is a 5% trailing dividend yield.

**The economy, despite what the news or Trump says, is dogshit:**

•	The stock market is not indicative of a healthy economy

•	The GDP is also not indicative of a healthy economy. The GDP is the accumulation of all dollars that have exchanged hands. This includes purchases made through credit, debt and the interest therein. 

•	Corporate Credit as a percentage of GDP is at an ATH

•	Record low unemployment is ALWAYS met with a recession soon after

•	Record Government Debt

•	Record Corporate Debt

•	Record Personal Debt

•	Record Auto Loan Defaults - both percentage of loans and number amount

•	The Fed was not able to balance their budget sheet. They will be forced to go back to QE and add on to their $3.8T.

**Recession is coming and the Fed can’t do shit about it this time:**

•	2008 worked because the fed convinced investors that they would normalize their balance sheet. When they end QT in September, they will prove that they can NOT balance their budget sheet.

•	The fed will decrease rates, eventually all the way to zero, but it will have no effect. Going from 2.5% to 0% will not make a big enough difference.

**Inflation:**

•	The fed decreasing rates directly increases inflation

•	Due to recession, the fed will eventually go back to QE – this will increase inflation

•	Due to recession, the US debt will explode even further

•	Due to recession, the fed will do whatever it can for the US to not default on its debt. Including devaluing the dollar – this will increase inflation

•	Due to recession, the stock market will crash. This will cause main street to make a run on their IRAs, their 401ks and their pensions – this will increase inflation (This will also be fucking chaos).

•	The fed devaluing the dollar will create a rush in foreign markets to get out of the dollar – this will increase inflation

•	Russia is 100% out of the dollar – this will increase inflation

•	China has begun to pour their dollar reserves back into the US – this will increase inflation

**The best hedge against inflation – Gold.**

I believe they feel like they have more leeway now because Trump has showed weakness in calling off the missile strike. So that means more shit like we saw last week with the drone attack and oil tankers.

So I recently did a vertical call spread on SPY because I'm a pussy and I wanted to limit my downside risk.

What I didn't pay attention to was that the stock's ex-date was the 21st so for my short leg exercised on the 20th, I had the short position so I have to pay that dividend, 1.41 on 100 shares for $141.  And I bought the shares on the 21st so I don't get shit. Not too big an issue but definitely a lesson learned, so watch out for dividend dates, don't be dumb like me.

/es futures have been open for a few hours now and continue to play at this 2960 resistance area. If this doesn't breakout soon after open, the neutral start to the week could begin selling by big money. If we can get a breakout overnight or early in market open the possibility of SPY 300 / SPX 3000 is very high.

On the breakout, SPY call options with a high 295-297 strike for 2+ weeks out will profit nicely with low time decay.
On a breakdown of this channel median, SPY 290 puts for 3+ weeks out will profit on the breakdown of 290 and realization that SPY 300 is further away than expected.

533,t3_c4s2fw,"&gt; Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump announced new sanctions against Iran Monday in part to retaliate after the downing of a US drone last week, with the punitive measures targeting Iran's most senior leader, military officials and its top diplomat, Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.
&gt; 
&gt; Speaking to reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said he signed an executive order imposing ""hard hitting"" sanctions on Iran that will deny Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, his office ""and many others"" access to financial instruments.

&gt; ""Today's actions follow a series of aggressive behaviors by the Iranian regime in recent weeks, including shooting down of US drones,"" Trump said, flanked by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Vice President Mike Pence. ""The supreme leader of Iran is one who ultimately is responsible of the hostile conduct of the regime. He's respected within his country. His office oversees the regime's most brutal instruments including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.""

&gt; Mnuchin told reporters in a briefing after Trump's announcement that ""these sanctions are all very important for recent activities. The President has also instructed me that we will be designating Zarif later this week.""

&gt; Trump said the sanctions ""will deny the supreme leader and the supreme leaders office and those closely affiliated with him and the office access to key financial resources and support. The assets of Ayatollah Khomeini will not be spared from the sanctions.""
&gt; Mnuchin said they would ""lock up literally billions of dollars of assets.""

&gt; While Trump called the sanctions a ""strong and proportionate response,"" neither he nor Mnuchin would offer exact details about what the retaliation was for. Trump said, ""this was something that was going to happen anyway.""

&gt; Mnuchin said ""some of this was in the works, some of this was a result of recent activities. I'm not going to identify which is which.""
